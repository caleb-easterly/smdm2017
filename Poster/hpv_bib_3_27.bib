	abstract = {{BackgroundThe} control arm of {PATRICIA} ({PApillomaTRIal} against Cancer In young Adults, {NCT}00122681) was used to investigate the risk of progression from cervical {HPV} infection to cervical intraepithelial neoplasia ({CIN}) or clearance of infection, and associated determinants.   Methods and {FindingsWomen} aged 15-25 years were enrolled. A 6-month persistent {HPV} infection (6MPI) was defined as detection of the same {HPV} type at two consecutive evaluations over 6 months and clearance as ≥2 type-specific {HPV} negative samples taken at two consecutive intervals of approximately 6 months following a positive sample. The primary endpoint was {CIN} grade 2 or greater ({CIN}2+) associated with the same {HPV} type as a 6MPI. Secondary endpoints were {CIN}1+/{CIN}3+ associated with the same {HPV} type as a 6MPI; {CIN}1+/{CIN}2+/{CIN}3+ associated with an infection of any duration; and clearance of infection. The analyses included 4825 women with 16,785 infections (3363 womenwith 6902 6MPIs). Risk of developing a {CIN}1+/{CIN}2+/{CIN}3+ associated with same {HPV} type as a 6MPI varied with {HPV} type and was significantly higher for oncogenic versus non-oncogenic types. Hazard ratios for development of {CIN}2+ were 10.44 (95\% {CI}: 6.96-15.65), 9.65 (5.97-15.60), 5.68 (3.50-9.21), 5.38 (2.87-10.06) and 3.87 (2.38-6.30) for {HPV}-16, {HPV}-33, {HPV}-31, {HPV}-45 and {HPV}-18, respectively. {HPV}-16 or {HPV}-33 6MPIs had {\textasciitilde}25-fold higher risk for progression to {CIN}3+. Previous or concomitant {HPV} infection or {CIN}1+ associated with a different {HPV} type increased risk. Of the different oncogenic {HPV} types, {HPV}-16 and {HPV}-31 infections were least likely to clear.   {ConclusionsCervical} infections with oncogenic {HPV} types increased the risk of {CIN}2+ and {CIN}3+. Previous or concomitant infection or {CIN}1+ also increased the risk. {HPV}-16 and {HPV}-33 have by far the highest risk of progression to {CIN}3+, and {HPV}-16 and {HPV}-31 have the lowest chance of clearance.},

	abstract = {End of study analyses of the phase {III} trials of prophylactic human papillomavirus ({HPV}) virus-like particle ({VLP}) vaccines in young women are now largely completed. Two distinct vaccines were evaluated, Gardasil® (Merck \& Co., Whitehouse Station, {NJ} {USA}) a quadrivalent vaccine containing {VLPs} of types 6, 11, 16 and 18 and Cervarix® ({GlaxoSmithKline} Biologicals, Rixensart, Belgium), a bivalent vaccine containing {VLPs} of types 16 and 18. Both vaccines exhibited excellent safety and immunogenicity profiles. The vaccines also demonstrated remarkably high and similar efficacy against the vaccine-targeted types for a range of cervical endpoints from persistent infection to cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 ({CIN}3) in women naïve to the corresponding type at the time of vaccination. However, protection from incident infection or disease from non-vaccine types was restricted, and the vaccines had no effect on prevalent infection or disease. Gardasil® also demonstrated strong protection against genital warts and vulvar/vaginal neoplasia associated with the vaccine types. In other trials, Gardasil® protected mid-adult women from incident infection and {CIN} caused by the vaccine types and protected men for incident infection, genital warts and anal intraepithelial neoplasia by the vaccine types. Cervarix® protected against vaccine-targeted anal infections in women in an end of study evaluation. For practical reasons, efficacy studies have not been conducted in the primary target populations of current vaccination programs, adolescent girls and boys. However, immunogenicity bridging studies demonstrating excellent safety and strong immune responses in adolescence, coupled with the documentation of durable antibody responses and protection in young adults, leads to an optimistic projection of the effectiveness of the vaccines in adolescent vaccination programs. Taken together, the excellent clinical trial results strongly support the potential of the vaccines as high value public health interventions and justify their widespread implementation to prevent anogenital {HPV} infections and their associated neoplasia.

    abstract = { Background/Objective. Modelers lack a tool to systematically and clearly present complex model results, including those from sensitivity analyses. The objective was to propose linear regression metamodeling as a tool to increase transparency of decision analytic models and better communicate their results. Methods. We used a simplified cancer cure model to demonstrate our approach. The model computed the lifetime cost and benefit of 3 treatment options for cancer patients. We simulated 10,000 cohorts in a probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) and regressed the model outcomes on the standardized input parameter values in a set of regression analyses. We used the regression coefficients to describe measures of sensitivity analyses, including threshold and parameter sensitivity analyses. We also compared the results of the PSA to deterministic full-factorial and one-factor-at-a-time designs. Results. The regression intercept represented the estimated base-case outcome, and the other coefficients described the relative parameter uncertainty in the model. We defined simple relationships that compute the average and incremental net benefit of each intervention. Metamodeling produced outputs similar to traditional deterministic 1-way or 2-way sensitivity analyses but was more reliable since it used all parameter values. Conclusions. Linear regression metamodeling is a simple, yet powerful, tool that can assist modelers in communicating model characteristics and sensitivity analyses. }

	abstract = {(1) A mathematical investigation has been made of the progress of an epidemic in a homogeneous population. It has been assumed that complete immunity is conferred by a single attack, and that an individual is not infective at the moment at which he receives infection. With these reservations the problem has been investigated in its most general aspects, and the following conclusions have been arrived at. (2) In general a threshold density of population is found to exist, which depends upon the infectivity, recovery and death rates peculiar to the epidemic. No epidemic can occur if the population density is below this threshold value. (3) Small increases of the infectivity rate may lead to large epidemics; also, if the population density slightly exceeds its threshold value the effect of an epidemic will be to reduce the density as far below the threshold value as initially it was above it. (4) An epidemic, in general, comes to an end, before the susceptible population has been exhausted.

	abstract = {(1) A mathematical investigation has been made of the prevalence of a disease in a population from which certain individuals are being removed as the result of the disease, whilst fresh individuals are being introduced as the result of birth or immigration. Allowance is made for the effects of the immunity produced as the result of an attack of the disease, but the effect of deaths from other causes is not taken into account, and the action of the disease is supposed to be independent of the age of the individual. (2) As a special case of the above, results have been obtained for a closed population in which no deaths occur and to which no fresh individuals are added, but in which the individuals after being infected acquire immunity, and then may be again infected. A threshold density of population exists analogous to that described in the previous paper, which is such that no disease can exist in a population, the density of which is below the threshold. (3) In other special cases investigated when either immigration or birth is operative in the supply of fresh individuals, as well as in the general case, only one steady state of disease is possible. To reach this state the population must be of a certain density which will be determined by the functions characterizing the infectivity, morbidity, etc., of the disease. (4) Increase of the immigration rate or of the birth-rate results in an increase in the rate of infection of the healthy individuals and also in the percentage rate of infection, the percentage of sick, and in the percentage of mortality from the disease. This result is, of course, a necessary consequence of our assumption that the disease is the only cause of death. (5) More particular results have been obtained by substituting constants in the place of the undetermined functions assumed in the general theory. Further, under these conditions the nature of the steady states has been more fully investigated and it has been shown that in all cases, except one, the steady states are stable ones. In the exception, a disturbance would result in purely periodic oscillations about the steady state.},

	issn = {0092-8240},
	abstract = {(1) The mathematical investigation of the progress of an infectious disease in a community of susceptible individuals has been extended to include the case where members of the community are removed as the result of some general cause of death acting according to constant non-specific death rates, as well as by death from the disease itself. Under the more general conditions here dealt with the main conclusions arrived at in the previous paper remain qualitatively unaltered. The limitations which remain are that the susceptibility and the infective power of the individual are supposed to be independent of his age, and further that specific individual immunity does not exist in the sense that the part of the population which escapes infection is assumed to be just as susceptible as the whole population would have been if it had not been infected. (2) In the general case a unique steady state is found to exist provided that certain relatively simple conditions are satisfied. In the special cases considered a unique steady state in general exists when these conditions continue to be satisfied; but in particular instances, when these conditions are not satisfied, unique steady states will exist provided that certain other requirements are fulfilled. (3) Increase of birth rates, in general, increases both the absolute and the relative prevalence of the disease in its steady state. The effect of increase in the non-specific death rates is less simple, but has been worked out at some length. Decrease in the infectivity of the disease or in the susceptibility of the uninfected results in an increase in the whole population density as well as in an increase in the number of infected. The effect upon the relative incidence of the disease cannot be simply expressed, but it has been worked out in detail in the text. In the absence of immigration, and with the birth rates and also the non-specific death rates equal for virgins and recovered, variation in infectivity or susceptibility will not alter the relative incidence of the disease. The total population, however, will increase with decrease of either of these two factors, whilst the number of diseased will also increase proportionately. (4) Two types of threshold values have been encountered. In the first type the quantity in question must initially exceed the threshold value if the event or process is to occur in the population. Two examples of this type have been found, namely, in Cases (4) and (2'd).({ABSTRACT} {TRUNCATED} {AT} 400 {WORDS})},

The first two vaccines have been a great success, hundreds of millions of women and a much smaller number of men have been vaccinated ever since. In a few countries with high vaccination coverage, in particular Australia but also parts of Great Britain and others, clinical impact of vaccination programs is already visible and there are indications for herd immunity as well. Vaccine efficacy is higher than originally estimated and the vaccines have an excellent safety profile. Gardasil9 is a second generation {HPV} virus-like particle vaccine that was licensed in 2015 and there are more to come in the near future. Currently, burning questions in respect to {HPV} vaccination are the duration of protection-especially in regard to cross-protection-, reduction of the three-dose regimen and its impact on cross-protection; and duration of response, as well as protection against oropharyngeal {HPV} infections. Furthermore, researchers are seeking to overcome limitations of the {VLP} vaccines, namely low thermal stability, cost, invasive administration, limited coverage of non-vaccine {HPV} types, and lack of therapeutic efficacy. In this review we summarize the current status of licensed {VLP} vaccines and address questions related to second and third generation {HPV} vaccines.},

{METHODS}: We developed a simple model, based primarily on the distribution of lifetime numbers of sex partners across the population and the per-partnership probability of acquiring {HPV}, to estimate the lifetime probability of acquiring {HPV} in the United States in the time frame before {HPV} vaccine availability.
{RESULTS}: We estimated the average lifetime probability of acquiring {HPV} among those with at least 1 opposite sex partner to be 84.6\% (range, 53.6\%-95.0\%) for women and 91.3\% (range, 69.5\%-97.7\%) for men. Under base case assumptions, more than 80\% of women and men acquire {HPV} by age 45 years.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Our results are consistent with estimates in the existing literature suggesting a high lifetime probability of {HPV} acquisition and are supported by cohort studies showing high cumulative {HPV} incidence over a relatively short period, such as 3 to 5 years.},

Current mathematical modeling approaches typically use either single-parameter or local sensitivity analyses. However, these methods do not accurately assess uncertainty and sensitivity in the system as, by default they hold all other parameters fixed at baseline values. Using techniques described within we demonstrate how a multi-dimensional parameter space can be studied globally so all uncertainties can be identified. Further, uncertainty and sensitivity analysis techniques can help to identify and ultimately control uncertainties. In this work we develop methods for applying existing analytical tools to perform analyses on a variety of mathematical and computer models. We compare two specific types of global sensitivity analysis indexes that have proven to be among the most robust and efficient. Through familiar and new examples of mathematical and computer models, we provide a complete methodology for performing these analyses, both in deterministic and stochastic settings, and propose novel techniques to handle problems encountered during this type of analyses.},

We investigate five global {SA} methods-scatter plots, the Morris and Sobol' methods, Latin hypercube sampling-partial rank correlation coefficient and the sensitivity heat map method-and detail their relative merits and pitfalls when applied to a microparasite (cholera) and macroparasite (schistosomaisis) transmission model. The methods investigated yielded similar results with respect to identifying influential parameters, but offered specific insights that vary by method. The classical methods differed in their ability to provide information on the quantitative relationship between parameters and model output, particularly over time. The heat map approach provides information about the group sensitivity of all model state variables, and the parameter sensitivity spectrum obtained using this method reveals the sensitivity of all state variables to each parameter over the course of the simulation period, especially valuable for expressing the dynamic sensitivity of a microparasite epidemic model to its parameters. A summary comparison is presented to aid infectious disease modellers in selecting appropriate methods, with the goal of improving model performance and design.},

Prophylactic vaccination of 16- to 23-year-old females with a quadrivalent human papillomavirus (types 6, 11, 16, 18) L1 virus-like particle vaccine has been shown to prevent type-specific human papillomavirus infection and associated clinical disease. We conducted a noninferiority immunogenicity study to bridge the efficacy findings in young women to preadolescent and adolescent girls and boys, who represent a primary target for human papillomavirus vaccination. {METHODS}. We enrolled 506 girls and 510 boys (10-15 years of age) and 513 females (16-23 years of age). Participants were vaccinated on day 1, at month 2, and at month 6, and serology testing was performed on day 1 and at months 3 and 7 on blinded samples. Neutralizing antibody concentrations were determined using type-specific immunoassays and summarized as geometric mean titers and seroconversion rates. Vaccine tolerability also was assessed. {RESULTS}. By month 7, seroconversion rates were {\textgreater}= 99\% for all 4 human papillomavirus types in each group. By month 7, compared with women, anti-human papilloma virus geometric mean titers in girls or boys were noninferior and were 1.7- to 2.7-fold higher. Most ({\textgreater} 97\%) injection-site adverse events were mild to moderate in intensity. Significantly more boys (13.8\%) and girls (12.8\%) than women (7.3\%) reported fevers {\textgreater}= 37.8 degrees C within 5 days of vaccination. Most (96.4\%) fevers were mild ({\textless} 39 degrees C). {CONCLUSIONS}. Noninferior immunogenic responses to all 4 human papillomavirus types in the quadrivalent vaccine permit the bridging of efficacy data that were generated in young women to girls. The results in boys lend support for the implementation of gender-neutral human papillomavirus vaccination programs. This vaccine generally was well tolerated.},

In addition, the complexity of current medical decision models commonly requires simulating individual subjects, which introduces stochastic uncertainty. The combined analysis of uncertainty and heterogeneity often involves complex nested Monte Carlo simulations to obtain the model outcomes of interest. In this article, the authors distinguish eight model types, each dealing with a different combination of patient heterogeneity, parameter uncertainty, and stochastic uncertainty. The analyses that are required to obtain the model outcomes are expressed in equations, explained in stepwise algorithms, and demonstrated in examples. Patient heterogeneity is represented by frequency distributions and analyzed with Monte Carlo simulation. Parameter uncertainty is represented by probability distributions and analyzed with 2nd-order Monte Carlo simulation (aka probabilistic sensitivity analysis). Stochastic uncertainty is analyzed with 1st-order Monte Carlo simulation (i.e., trials or random walks). This article can be used as a reference for analyzing complex models with more than one type of uncertainty and patient heterogeneity.},

A prophylactic quadrivalent vaccine against oncogenic {HPV} 16/18 and warts-causing genital {HPV} 6/11 types is currently available in several countries. Licensure of a bivalent vaccine against oncogenic {HPV} 16/18 is expected in the near future. This paper presents a two-sex, deterministic model for assessing the potential impact of a prophylactic {HPV} vaccine with several properties. The model is based on the susceptible-infective-removed ({SIR}) compartmental structure. Important epidemiological thresholds such as the basic and effective reproduction numbers and a measure of vaccine impact are derived. We find that if the effective reproduction number is greater than unity, there is a locally unstable infection-free equilibrium and a unique, globally asymptotically stable endemic equilibrium. If the effective reproduction number is less than unity, the infection-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable, and {HPV} will be eliminated.},

	abstract = {Cytology-based screening has reduced cervical cancer mortality in countries able to implement, sustain and financially support organized programs that achieve broad coverage. These ongoing secondary prevention efforts considerably complicate the question of whether vaccination against human papillomavirus ({HPV}) types 16 and 18 should be introduced. Policy questions focus primarily on the target ages of vaccination, appropriate ages for a temporary "catch-up" program, possible revisions in screening policies to optimize synergies with vaccination, including the increased used of {HPV} {DNA} testing, and the inclusion of boys in the vaccination program. Decision-analytic models are increasingly being developed to simulate disease burden and interventions in different settings in order to evaluate the benefits and cost-effectiveness of primary and secondary interventions for informed decision-making. This article is a focused review on existing mathematical models that have been used to evaluate {HPV} vaccination in the context of developed countries with existing screening programs. Despite variations in model assumptions and uncertainty in existing data, pre-adolescent vaccination of girls has been consistently found to be attractive in the context of current screening practices, provided there is complete and lifelong vaccine protection and widespread vaccination coverage. Questions related to catch-up vaccination programs, potential benefits of other non-cervical cancer outcomes and inclusion of boys are subject to far more uncertainty, and results from these analyses have reached conflicting conclusions. Most analyses find that some catch-up vaccination is warranted but becomes increasingly unattractive as the catch-up age is extended, and vaccination of boys is unlikely to be cost-effective if reasonable levels of coverage are achieved in girls or coverage among girls can be improved. The objective of this review is to highlight points of consensus and qualitative themes, to discuss the areas of divergent findings, and to provide insight into critical decisions related to cervical cancer prevention.

	doi = {10.1002/sim.5545},
	abstract = {Two sexual mixing matrices previously used in models of sexually transmitted infections ({STIs}) are intended to calculate the probability of sexual interaction between age groups and sexual behaviour subgroups. When these matrices are used to specify multiple criteria for how people select sexual partners (such as age group and sexual behaviour class), their conditional probability structure means that they have in practice been prone to misuse. We constructed revised mixing matrices that incorporate a corrected conditional probability structure and then used one of them to examine the effect of this revision on population modelling of {STIs}. Using a dynamic model of human papillomavirus ({HPV}) transmission as an example, we examined changes to estimates of {HPV} prevalence and the relative reduction in age-standardised {HPV} incidence after the commencement of publicly funded {HPV} vaccination in Australia. When all other model specifications were left unchanged, the revised mixing matrix initially led to estimates of age-specific oncogenic {HPV} prevalence that were up to 11\% higher than our previous models at certain ages. After re-calibrating the model by modifying unobservable parameters characterising {HPV} natural history, the revised mixing matrix yielded similar estimates to our previous models, predicting that vaccination would lead to relative {HPV} incidence reductions of 43\% and 85\% by 2010 and 2050, respectively, compared with 43\% and 86\% using the unrevised mixing matrix formulation. Our revised mixing matrix offers a rigorous alternative to commonly used mixing matrices, which can be used to reliably and explicitly accommodate conditional probabilities, with appropriate re-calibration of unobservable model parameters.

	volume = {27},
	issn = {1170-7690},
	abstract = {Increasingly, computer simulation models are used for economic and policy evaluation in cancer prevention and control. A model's predictions of key outcomes, such as screening effectiveness, depend on the values of unobservable natural history parameters. Calibration is the process of determining the values of unobservable parameters by constraining model output to replicate observed data. Because there are many approaches for model calibration and little consensus on best practices, we surveyed the literature to catalogue the use and reporting of these methods in cancer simulation models. We conducted a {MEDLINE} search (1980 through 2006) for articles on cancer-screening models and supplemented search results with articles from our personal reference databases. For each article, two authors independently abstracted pre-determined items using a standard form. Data items included cancer site, model type, methods used for determination of unobservable parameter values and description of any calibration protocol. All authors reached consensus on items of disagreement. Reviews and non-cancer models were excluded. Articles describing analytical models, which estimate parameters with statistical approaches (e.g. maximum likelihood) were catalogued separately. Models that included unobservable parameters were analysed and classified by whether calibration methods were reported and if so, the methods used. The review process yielded 154 articles that met our inclusion criteria and, of these, we concluded that 131 may have used calibration methods to determine model parameters. Although the term 'calibration' was not always used, descriptions of calibration or 'model fitting' were found in 50\% (n = 66) of the articles, with an additional 16\% (n = 21) providing a reference to methods. Calibration target data were identified in nearly all of these articles. Other methodological details, such as the goodness-of-fit metric, were discussed in 54\% (n = 47 of 87) of the articles reporting calibration methods, while few details were provided on the algorithms used to search the parameter space. Our review shows that the use of cancer simulation modelling is increasing, although thorough descriptions of calibration procedures are rare in the published literature for these models. Calibration is a key component of model development and is central to the validity and credibility of subsequent analyses and inferences drawn from model predictions. To aid peer-review and facilitate discussion of modelling methods, we propose a standardized Calibration Reporting Checklist for model documentation.},

	abstract = {Markov chains constitute a common way of modelling the progression of a chronic disease through various severity states. For these models, a transition matrix with the probabilities of moving from one state to another for a specific time interval is usually estimated from cohort data. Quite often, however, the cohort is observed at specific times with intervals that may be greater than the interval of interest. The transition matrix computed then needs to be decomposed in order to estimate the desired interval transition matrix suited to the model. Although simple to implement, this method of matrix decomposition can yet result in an invalid short-interval transition matrix with negative or complex entries. In this paper, we present a method for computing short-interval transition matrices that is based on regularization techniques. Our method operates separately on each row of the invalid short-interval transition matrix aiming to minimize an appropriate distance measure. We test our method on various matrix structures and sizes, and evaluate its performance on a real-life transition model for {HIV}-infected individuals. Copyright (C) 2007 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

From a population-based cohort of 40,399 women participating in cervical cancer screening established during 2002-2005, we selected all {HR} {HPV}-positive women (N = 7,778). During follow-up (2005-2008), we collected cervical samples from these women and tested them for {HPV} {DNA} to determine type-specific {HR} {HPV} persistence in the interval 1-4.5 years after enrolment. Data on hospitalisations, prescriptions and socioeconomic factors were obtained from nationwide registers. Women with abnormal cytology at baseline or who had undergone conisation during follow-up were excluded. Factors associated with persistence were identified by logistic regression analysis. The overall rate of {HR} {HPV} persistence was 31.4\%. The risk for persistence was significantly increased among women with a previous episode of genital warts ({OR}, 1.35; 95\% {CI}, 1.04-1.74), current use of oral contraceptives ({OR}, 1.35; 95\% {CI}, 1.13-1.63) or use of systemic glucocorticoids ({OR}, 2.04; 95\% {CI}, 1.16-3.56). The number of pregnancies or births or use of a hormonal intrauterine device, hormonal therapy or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs was not associated with risk for {HR} {HPV} persistence. A history of genital warts and current use of oral contraceptives or systemic glucocorticoids increased the risk, potentially indicating a decreased immune response to {HPV} infection. These findings suggest that host immune response characteristics are important in {HR} {HPV} persistence and consequently in cervical cancer development.},

	abstract = {Objectives Female anorectal Chlamydia trachomatis (chlamydia) infections are common irrespective of recent anal sex. We explored the role of anorectal infections in chlamydia transmission and estimated the impact of interventions aimed at improved detection and treatment of anorectal infections.
Methods We developed a pair compartmental model of heterosexuals aged 15–29 years attending {STI} clinics, in which women can be susceptible to or infected with chlamydia urogenitally and/or anorectally and men urogenitally. Transmission probabilities per vaginal and anal sex act, together with an autoinoculation probability, were estimated by fitting to anatomic site-specific prevalence data (14\% urogenital; 11\% anorectal prevalence). We investigated the 10-year reduction in female chlamydia prevalence of interventions (universal anorectal testing of female {STI} clinic attendees or doxycycline use for urogenital chlamydia) relative to continued current care (anorectal testing on indication and doxycycline for anorectal and azithromycin for urogenital chlamydia).
Results The transmission probability per anal sex act was 5.8\% ({IQR} 3.0–8.3\%), per vaginal sex act 2.0\% ({IQR} 1.7–2.2\%) and the daily autoinoculation probability was 0.7\% ({IQR} 0.5–1.0\%). More anorectal chlamydia infections were caused by autoinoculation than by recent anal sex. Universal anorectal testing reduced population prevalence modestly with 8.7\% ({IQR} 7.6–9.7\%), yet the reduction was double that of doxycycline use for urogenital infections (4.3\% ({IQR} 3.5–5.3\%)) relative to continued current care.
Conclusions Autoinoculation between anatomic sites in women might play a role in sustaining high chlamydia prevalence. A shift to more anorectal testing of female {STI} clinic attendees may be considered for its (albeit modest) impact on reducing prevalence.},

Frequently, the novel appears in this criticism as a realist narrative of a beautiful, working-class killer told from the perspective of her unrequited lover. In contrast, I argue that the novel portrays the narrator's failure to comprehend the choices that his alleged true love makes between sex work and murder. The novel provides insight into class difference in Colombian society and how discourse, fantasy, attraction, and aversion all play into the narrator's construction of his enigmatic heroine. At times, Rosario briefly reveals the narrator's posturing within the narrative and calls attention to the discursive obstacles that separate middle-class readers and slum residents.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Global data on age-specific prevalence of human papillomavirus ({HPV}) infection in males, especially for oncogenic {HPV} types 16 and 18, are essential for future efforts to prevent {HPV}-related diseases, including expanded access to {HPV} prophylactic vaccines for boys and young men. Methods: A systematic review of peer-reviewed publications was conducted to summarize worldwide data on genital {HPV}-{DNA} prevalence in men. Studies using polymerase chain reaction or hybrid capture detection assays were included. Results: Approximately 6,600 abstracts were identified. Of them, 64 reported age-specific {HPV} prevalence and were included in the review. Of these, 38 were from populations at high risk of {HPV} infections, such as sexually transmitted infection clinic attendees, human immunodeficiency virus-positive males, and male partners of women with {HPV} infection or abnormal cytology. The largest proportions of studies were from Europe (38\%) and North America (25\%), with smaller proportions from Central and South America (19\%), Asia (11\%), and Africa (5\%). Across all regions, data on {HPV} prevalence were generally limited to men {\textgreater}18 years of age. {HPV} prevalence was high among sexually active men in all regions but with considerable variation, from 1\% to 84\% among low-risk men and from 2\% to 93\% among high-risk men. Peak {HPV} prevalence spanned a wide range of ages and was generally not concentrated in the younger age groups. Age-specific prevalence curves were relatively flat or declined only slightly following peak prevalence. Conclusions: Genital {HPV} infection in men varies widely, both between and within high-and low-risk groups and by geographic region. Compared with that in women, {HPV} prevalence in men seems to peak at slightly older ages and remains constant or decreases slightly with increasing age, suggesting persistent {HPV} infection or a higher rate of reinfection.

	abstract = {Strong evidence now supports the adoption of cervical cancer prevention strategies that explicitly focus on persistent infection with the causal agent, human papillomavirus ({HPV}). To inform an evidence-based transition to a new public health approach for cervical cancer screening, we summarize the natural history and cervical carcinogenicity of {HPV} and discuss the promise and uncertainties of currently available screening methods. New {HPV} infections acquired at any age are virtually always benign, but persistent infections with one of approximately 12 carcinogenic {HPV} types explain virtually all cases of cervical cancer. In the absence of an overtly persistent {HPV} infection, the risk of cervical cancer is extremely low. Thus, {HPV} test results predict the risk of cervical cancer and its precursors (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3) better and longer than cytological or colposcopic abnormalities, which are signs of {HPV} infection. The logical and inevitable move to {HPV}-based cervical cancer prevention strategies will require longer screening intervals that will disrupt current gynecologic and cytology laboratory practices built on frequent screening. A major challenge will be implementing programs that do not overtreat {HPV}-positive women who do not have obvious long-term persistence of {HPV} or treatable lesions at the time of initial evaluation. The greatest potential for reduction in cervical cancer rates from {HPV} screening is in low-resource regions that can implement infrequent rounds of low-cost {HPV} testing and treatment.},

Thus, we completed an analysis of the age-specific incidence and clearance rates of high-risk ({HR}) {HPV} infections in 448 women participating in a multi-centre screening study in three New Independent States countries. At baseline, 239 of the 448 women were negative for {HR} {HPV} {DNA}, whereas 209 were {HR} {HPV}-positive and cleared {HR} {HPV} during the prospective follow-up. The cumulative incidence and clearance of {HR} {HPV} were modelled using life-table techniques. The monthly incidence rates of {HR} {HPV} were significantly agedependent (P = 0.0001), whereas monthly clearance rates remained constant across the nine age groups (P = 0.920). The incidence rates (3.04\% and 2.65\%) exceeded the clearance rates in the two youngest age groups only, 15-20- and 21-25-year-old women, and remained lower (0-0.84\%) in all other age groups. The cumulative rate of incident {HR} {HPV} infections (1.0\%) was significantly lower than the overall clearance rate (1.9\%) (P = 0.001). In life-table analysis, incident {HR} {HPV} infections between the nine age groups were significantly different (P = 0.0001), while cumulative {HR} {HPV} clearance was identical in all groups (P = 0.822). The accumulation of incident {HR} {HPV} infections is significantly age-related, whereas virus clearance remains constant between 15 and 60 years of age. These distinct age specific incidence and clearance rates explain the differences in age-specific prevalence of {HR} {HPV} infections in the study population.},

	abstract = {Using population and epidemiologic data for 48 countries in sub-Saharan Africa, we used a model-based approach to estimate cervical cancer cases and deaths averted, disability-adjusted life years ({DALYs}) averted and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (1\$ (international dollar) per {DALY} averted) for human papillomavirus ({HPV}) vaccination of pre-adolescent girls. Additional epidemiologic data from Uganda and South Africa informed estimates of cancer risk reduction and cost-effectiveness ratios associated with pre-adolescent female vaccination followed by screening of women over age 30. Assuming 70\% vaccination coverage, over 670,000 cervical cancer cases would be prevented among women in five consecutive birth cohorts vaccinated as young adolescents; over 90\% of cases averted were projected to occur in countries eligible for {GAVI} Alliance support. There were large variations in health benefits across countries attributable to differential cancer rates, population size, and population age structure. More than half of {DALYs} averted in sub-Saharan Africa were in Nigeria, Tanzania, Uganda, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, and Mozambique. When the cost per vaccinated girl was I\$5 (\$0.55 per dose), {HPV} vaccination was cost-saving in 38 sub-Saharan African countries, and cost I\$300 per {DALY} averted or less in the remaining countries. At this vaccine price, pre-adolescent {HPV} vaccination followed by screening three times per lifetime in adulthood cost I\$300 per year of life saved ({YLS}) in Uganda (per capita {GDP} I\$1,140) and I\$1,000 per {YLS} in South Africa (per capita {GDP} I\$9,480). In nearly all countries assessed, {HPV} vaccination of pre-adolescent girls could be very cost-effective if the cost per vaccinated girl is less than I\$25-I\$50, reflecting a vaccine price being offered to the {GAVI} Alliance. In-country decision makers will need to consider many other factors, such as affordability, acceptability, feasibility, and competing health priorities, when making decisions about cervical cancer prevention.

	abstract = {Context Human papillomaviruses ({HPVs}) are known to cause most cervical cancer worldwide, but the utility of {HPV} {DNA} testing in cervical cancer prevention has not been determined. Objective To provide comprehensive data on the screening performance of {HPV} testing for the most common carcinogenic types, at different levels of analytic sensitivity. Design Laboratory analysis conducted during 1993-1995, using 3 cytologic techniques and cervicography, followed by colposcopic examination of women with any abnormal cervical finding, to detect all high-grade intraepithelial lesions and cancer (reference standard of clinically significant disease). The {HPV} testing was performed subsequently with masking regarding clinical findings. Setting Guanacaste Province, Costa Rica, a region with a high age-adjusted incidence of cervical cancer. Participants Of 11742 randomly selected women, 8554 nonpregnant, sexually active women without hysterectomies underwent initial {HPV} {DNA} testing using the original Hybrid Capture Tube test; a stratified subsample of 1119 specimens was retested using the more analytically sensitive second generation assay, the Hybrid Capture {II} test. Main Outcome Measures Receiver operating characteristic analysis of detection of cervical high-grade intraepithelial lesions and cancer by {HPV} {DNA} testing based on different cut points of positivity. Results An analytic sensitivity of 1.0 pg/{mL} using the second generation assay would have permitted detection of 88.4\% of 138 high-grade lesions and cancers (all 12 cancers were {HPV}-positive), with colposcopic referral of 12.3\% of women. Papanicolaou testing using atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance as a cut point for referral resulted in 77.7\% sensitivity and 94.2\% specificity, with 6.9\% referred. Specificity of the second generation assay for positivity for high-grade lesions and cancer was 89.0\%, with 33.8\% of remaining {HPV} {DNA}-positive subjects having low-grade or equivocal microscopically evident lesions. The higher detection threshold of 10 pg/{mL} used with the original assay had a sensitivity of 74.8\% and a specificity of 93.4\%, Lower levels of detection with the second generation assay ({\textless}1 pg/{mL}) proved clinically nonspecific without gains in diagnostic sensitivity, Conclusions In this study population, a cut point of 1.0 pg/{mL} using the second generation assay permitted sensitive detection of cervical high-grade lesions and cancer, yielding an apparently optimal trade-off between high sensitivity and reasonable specificity for this test. The test will perform best in settings in which sensitive detection of high-grade lesions and cancer is paramount. Because {HPV} prevalence varies by population, {HPV} testing positive predictive value for detection of high-grade lesions and cancer will vary accordingly, with implications for utility relative to other cervical cancer screening methods.},

	abstract = {Objective: Men who have sex with men ({MSM}) have higher rates of {HIV} and other sexually transmitted infections than women and heterosexual men. This elevated risk persists across age groups and reflects biological and behavioral factors; yet, there have been few direct comparisons of sexual behavior patterns between these populations. Methods: We compared sexual behavior patterns of {MSM} and male and female heterosexuals aged 18-39 using 4 population-based random digit dialing surveys. A 1996-1998 survey in 4 {US} cities and 2 Seattle surveys (2003 and 2006) provided estimates for {MSM}; a 2003-2004 Seattle survey provided data about heterosexual men and women. Results: Sexual debut occurred earlier among {MSM} than heterosexuals. {MSM} reported longer cumulative lifetime periods of new partner acquisition than heterosexuals and a more gradual decline in new partnership formation with age. Among {MSM}, 86\% of 18- to 24-year-olds and 72\% of 35- to 39-year-olds formed a new partnership during the previous year, compared with 56\% of heterosexual men and 34\% of women at 18-24 years, and 21\% and 10\%, respectively, at 35-39 years. {MSM} were also more likely to choose partners {\textgreater}5 years older and were 2-3 times as likely as heterosexuals to report recent concurrent partnerships. {MSM} reported more consistent condom use during anal sex than heterosexuals reported during vaginal sex. Conclusions: {MSM} have longer periods of partnership acquisition, a higher prevalence of partnership concurrency, and more age disassortative mixing than heterosexuals. These factors likely help to explain higher {HIV}/sexually transmitted infections rates among {MSM}, despite higher levels of condom use.},

	doi = {10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-09-1251},
	abstract = {Background: Lead time, the estimated time by which screening advances the date of diagnosis, is used to calculate the risk of overdiagnosis. We sought to describe empirically the distribution of lead times between an elevated prostate-specific antigen ({PSA}) and subsequent prostate cancer diagnosis. Methods: We linked the Swedish cancer registry to two independent cohorts: 60-year-olds sampled in 1981-1982 and 51- to 56-year-olds sampled in 1982-1985. We used univariate kernel density estimation to characterize the lead time distribution. Linear regression was used to model the lead time as a function of baseline {PSA} and logistic regression was used to test for an association between lead time and either stage or grade at diagnosis. Results: Of 1,167 older men, 132 were diagnosed with prostate cancer, of which 57 had {PSA} {\textgreater}= 3 ng/{mL} at baseline; 495 of 4,260 younger men were diagnosed with prostate cancer, of which 116 had {PSA} {\textgreater}= 3 ng/{mL} at baseline. The median lead time was slightly longer in the younger men (12.8 versus 11.8 years). In both cohorts, wide variation in lead times followed an approximately normal distribution. Longer lead times were significantly associated with a lower risk of high-grade disease in older and younger men [odds ratio, 0.82 (P = 0.023) and 0.77 (P {\textless} 0.001)]. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that early changes in the natural history of the disease are associated with high-grade cancer at diagnosis. Impact: The distinct differences between the observed distribution of lead times and those used in modeling studies illustrate the need to model overdiagnosis rates using empirical data.

When this model is fit to the above data, the parameters of f as well as the parameter(s) governing screening sensitivity must be estimated. Previously, g was either assumed to be equal to clinical incidence or assumed to be a constant or exponential function that also had to be estimated. Here we assume that the underlying incidence, I. in the study population (in the absence of screening) is known. With I known, g then becomes a function of f, which can be solved for using (numerical) deconvolution, thus eliminating the need to estimate g or make assumptions about it. Since numerical deconvolution procedures may be highly unstable, however, we incorporate a smoothing procedure that produces a realistic g function while still closely reproducing the original incidence function I upon convolution with f. We have also added the concept of competing mortality to the convolution model. This, along with the realistic preclinical incidence function described above, results in more accurate estimates of sojourn time and lead time and allows for estimation of quantities related to overdiagnosis, which we define here.},

Unfortunately, {CD}4 cell counts are subject to substantial measurement error and short timescale variability. Thus, fitting a Markov chain to raw {CD}4 cell count measurements does not determine the transition probabilities for the true or underlying {CD}4 cell counts; the measurement error results in a process that is too rough. Assuming independent measurement errors, we propose a likelihood-based method for estimating the 'true' or underlying transition probabilities. The Markov structure allows efficient calculation of the likelihood by using hidden Markov model methodology. As an example, we consider {CD}4 cell count data from 430 {HIV}-infected participants in the San Francisco Men's Health Study by categorizing the marker data into seven stages; up to 17 observations are available for each individual. We find that including measurement error both produces a significantly better fit and provides a model for {CD}4 progression that is more biologically reasonable.},

Though it is not appropriate for all clinical situations, the method can be used for most diagnostic tests whenever information is desired for its own sake or when reducing uncertainty is the goal of testing. The method also is appropriate in those situations where benefits and costs cannot be specified precisely enough to permit test optimization based on a balancing of anticipated goods and evils.

The result is an over- or underestimation, respectively, of quality-adjusted life expectancy and cost, compared with the results that would be obtained if transitions were modeled to occur randomly throughout each cycle. The standard half-cycle correction ({HCC}) is used to remedy the bias. However, the standard approach to the {HCC} is problematic: It does not account for discounting or for the shape of intermediate state membership functions. Application of the standard approach to the {HCC} also has no numerical effect on the resulting incremental cost-effectiveness ratio or change in net health benefit under certain circumstances. Alternatives to the standard {HCC}, in order of ease of use, include no correction, the life-table approach, the cycle-tree method, and a correction based on Simpson's rule. For less complex decision models in which the computational burden is not large, reducing the cycle length to a month or less and using no correction should result in small estimation biases. With more complex models, where cycle lengths larger than 1 month may be necessary to make computation feasible, we recommend the cycle tree approach. The latter is relatively easy to apply and has an intuitive appeal: Hypothetical subjects who transition from one state to another, on average halfway through a cycle, should receive half of the value associated with the state from which they come and half the value of the state to which they are going.},

The longer patients with diabetes and foot ulcers are observed, the higher the likelihood that they will develop comorbidities that adversely influence ulcer recurrence, amputation and survival (for example peripheral arterial disease, renal failure or ischaemic heart disease). The purpose of our study was to quantify person and limb-related disease progression and the time-dependent influence of any associated factors (present at baseline or appearing during observation) based on which effective prevention and/or treatment strategies could be developed. Using a nine-state continuous-time Markov chain model with time-dependent risk factors, all living patients were divided into eight groups based on their ulceration (previous or current) and previous amputation (none, minor or major) status. State nine is an absorbing state (death). If all transitions are fully observable, this model can be decomposed into eight submodels, which can be analyzed using the methods of survival analysis for competing risks. The dependencies of the risk factors (covariates) were included in the submodels using Cox-like regression. The transition intensities and relative risks for covariates were calculated from long-term data of patients with diabetic foot ulcers collected in a single specialized center in North-Rhine Westphalia (Germany). The detected estimates were in line with previously published, but scarce, data. Together with the interesting new results obtained, this indicates that the proposed model may be useful for studying disease progression in larger samples of patients with diabetic foot ulcers.},

	abstract = {Background. Simulation models are essential tools for estimating benefits of cancer screening programs. Such models include a screening-effect model that represents how early detection by screening followed by treatment affects disease-specific survival. Two commonly used screening-effect models are the stage-shift model, where mortality benefits are explained by the shift to more favorable stages, and the cure model, where early detection enhances the chances of cure from disease. Objective. This article describes commonly used screening-effect models and analyses their predicted mortality benefit in a model for prostate cancer screening. Method. The {MISCAN} simulation model was used to predict the reduction of prostate cancer mortality in the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer ({ERSPC}) Rotterdam. The screening-effect models were included in the model. For each model the predictions of prostate cancer mortality reduction were calculated. The study compared 4 screening-effect models, which are versions of the stage-shift model or the cure model. Results. The stage-shift models predicted, after a follow-up of 9 years, reductions in prostate cancer mortality varying from 38\% to 63\% for {ERSPC}-Rotterdam compared with a 27\% reduction observed in the {ERSPC}. The cure models predicted reductions in prostate cancer mortality varying from 21\% to 27\%. Conclusions. The differences in predicted mortality reductions show the importance of validating models to observed trial mortality data. The stage-shift models considerably overestimated the mortality reduction. Therefore, the stage-shift models should be used with care, especially when modeling the effect of screening for cancers with long lead times, such as prostate cancer.},

	abstract = {When multiple parameters are estimated from the same synthesis model, it is likely that correlations will be induced between them. Network meta-analysis (mixed treatment comparisons) is one example where such correlations occur, along with meta-regression and syntheses involving multiple related outcomes. These correlations may affect the uncertainty in incremental net benefit when treatment options are compared in a probabilistic decision model, and it is therefore essential that methods are adopted that propagate the joint parameter uncertainty, including correlation structure, through the cost-effectiveness model. This tutorial paper sets out 4 generic approaches to evidence synthesis that are compatible with probabilistic cost-effectiveness analysis. The first is evidence synthesis by Bayesian posterior estimation and posterior sampling where other parameters of the cost-effectiveness model can be incorporated into the same software platform. Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation methods with {WinBUGS} software are the most popular choice for this option. A second possibility is to conduct evidence synthesis by Bayesian posterior estimation and then export the posterior samples to another package where other parameters are generated and the cost-effectiveness model is evaluated. Frequentist methods of parameter estimation followed by forward Monte Carlo simulation from the maximum likelihood estimates and their variance-covariance matrix represent'a third approach. A fourth option is bootstrap resamplinga frequentist simulation approach to parameter uncertainty. This tutorial paper also provides guidance on how to identify situations in which no correlations exist and therefore simpler approaches can be adopted. Software suitable for transferring data between different packages, and software that provides a user-friendly interface for integrated software platforms, offering investigators a flexible way of examining alternative scenarios, are reviewed.},

Results: The findings indicate that in high-resource settings such as Australia, there will be an approximately 0.16\% linear increase in population prevalence for each incremental increase of 1\% in the treatment failure rate. To compensate for higher assumed treatment failure, screening coverage will have to increase by between similar to 4\% and similar to 16\% to achieve a reduction of 50\% in chlamydia prevalence within 5 years under the scenarios evaluated. Higher treatment failure rates also substantially lengthen the time required for screening to deliver the same reductions in prevalence as are predicted under the conservative assumption of only 3\% treatment failure. The predicted relative increases are in the range similar to 6\% to 35\%, depending on the assumed treatment failure rate (8\%-23\%), screening strategy (female-only or male-plus-female) and the duration of screening (5 or 10 years). Conclusions: The rate of treatment failure may have a significant impact on the screening coverage and time required to achieve target reductions in chlamydia prevalence. The treatment failure rate should therefore be carefully considered when evaluating the potential effectiveness of proposed screening programs.},

Objective To compare the type-specific effectiveness of vaccination against {HPV} types 16, 18, 6 and 11. Methods An individual-based stochastic model of {HPV} transmission (18 {HPV}-types) in a population stratified by age, gender and sexual activity was developed. Multiple parameter sets were identified by fitting the model to sexual behaviour data and age-and type-specific {HPV} prevalence. Results Under base case assumptions (70\% coverage, 99\% vaccine efficacy per act and 20 years' duration of protection), vaccinating 12-year-old girls is predicted to reduce {HPV}-16, {HPV}-18 and {HPV}-6/11 prevalence by 61\% (80\% uncertainty interval ({UI}) 53-77), 92\% (80\% {UI} 65-100) and 100\% (80\% {UI} 97-100), respectively, 50 years after the start of the vaccination programme. Differences in type-specific vaccine effectiveness increased over time, and decreased with improved vaccine efficacy characteristics. Conclusions For the same vaccine efficacy, the population-level impact of {HPV} vaccination will most likely be different, with {HPV}-16, the most oncogenic type, having the lowest effectiveness.

Disease is considered to have three states: a disease-free state or a state in which the disease cannot be detected, a preclinical state and a clinical state. The natural history of the disease is assumed to be progressive. The parameters to be estimated, are the sensitivity of one or two disease detection modalities and the characteristics of the preclinical sojourn time distribution under both the stable disease and nonstable disease models. The stable-disease model assumes that the incidence or prevalence of a disease is independent of age or chronological time, while the nonstable disease model allows these quantities to depend on time. With the nonstable disease model, the relevant parameters can be jointly estimated by a two-step iteration procedure from the likelihood function. For the stable disease model, the sensitivity and the parameters of the sojourn time distribution of the preclinical state can be obtained directly from a conditional likelihood function.

Design Cost effectiveness study based on a transmission dynamic model of human papillomavirus vaccination. Two dose schedules for bivalent or quadrivalent human papillomavirus vaccines were assumed to provide 10, 20, or 30 years' vaccine type protection and cross protection or lifelong vaccine type protection without cross protection. Three dose schedules were assumed to give lifelong vaccine type and cross protection. Setting United Kingdom. Population Males and females aged 12-74 years. Interventions No, two, or three doses of human papillomavirus vaccine given routinely to 12 year old girls, with an initial catch-up campaign to 18 years. Main outcome measure Costs (from the healthcare provider's perspective), health related utilities, and incremental cost effectiveness ratios. Results Giving at least two doses of vaccine seems to be highly cost effective across the entire range of scenarios considered at the quadrivalent vaccine list price of 86.50 pound ((sic)109.23; \$136.00) per dose. If two doses give only 10 years' protection but adding a third dose extends this to lifetime protection, then the third dose also seems to be cost effective at 86.50 pound per dose (median incremental cost effectiveness ratio 17 pound 000, interquartile range 11 pound 700-25 pound 800). If two doses protect for more than 20 years, then the third dose will have to be priced substantially lower (median threshold price 31 pound, interquartile range 28- pound 35) pound to be cost effective. Results are similar for a bivalent vaccine priced at 80.50 pound per dose and when the same scenarios are explored by parameterising a Canadian model ({HPV}-{ADVISE}) with economic data from the United Kingdom. Conclusions Two dose human papillomavirus vaccine schedules are likely to be the most cost effective option provided protection lasts for at least 20 years. As the precise duration of two dose schedules may not be known for decades, cohorts given two doses should be closely monitored.},

	abstract = {Background. The {ONCOTYROL} Prostate Cancer Outcome and Policy ({PCOP}) model is a state-transition microsimulation model evaluating the benefits and harms of prostate cancer ({PCa}) screening. The natural history and detection component of the original model was based on the 2003 version of the Erasmus {MIcrosimulation} {SCreening} {ANalysis} ({MISCAN}) model, which was not calibrated to prevalence data. Compared with data from autopsy studies, prevalence of latent {PCa} assumed by the original model is low, which may bias the model toward screening. Our objective was to recalibrate the original model to match prevalence data from autopsy studies as well and compare benefit-harm predictions of the 2 model versions differing in prevalence. Methods. For recalibration, we reprogrammed the natural history and detection component of the {PCOP} model as a deterministic Markov state-transition cohort model in the statistical software package R. All parameters were implemented as variables or time-dependent functions and calibrated simultaneously in a single run. Observed data used as calibration targets included data from autopsy studies, cancer registries, and the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer. Compared models were identical except for calibrated parameters. Results. We calibrated 46 parameters. Prevalence from autopsy studies could not be fitted using the original parameter set. Additional parameters, allowing for interruption of disease progression and age-dependent screening sensitivities, were needed. Recalibration to higher prevalence demonstrated a considerable increase of overdiagnosis and decline of screening sensitivity, which significantly worsened the benefit-harm balance of screening. Conclusions. Our calibration suggests that not all cancers are at risk of progression, and screening sensitivity may be lower at older ages. {PCa} screening models that use calibration to simulate disease progression in the unobservable latent phase are highly sensitive to prevalence assumptions.},

Adding boys to the vaccination programme yielded marginal incremental benefits (3.6\% higher absolute cervical cancer risk reduction), compared with vaccinating girls alone at all coverages. At 25 international dollars (I\$) per vaccinated adolescent (I\$5 per dose), {HPV} vaccination of boys was below the threshold of Vietnam's per-capita {GDP} (I\$2800), with {ICERs} ranging from I\$734 per {QALY} at 25\% coverage to I\$2064 per {QALY} for 90\% coverage. Including health benefits from averting genital warts yielded more favourable {ICERs}, and vaccination of boys at I\$10/dose became cost-effective at or below 75\% coverage. Using a lower cost-effectiveness threshold of 50\% of Vietnam's {GDP} (I\$1400), vaccinating boys was no longer attractive at costs above I\$5 per dose regardless of coverage. {ConclusionVaccination} of boys may be cost-effective at low vaccine costs, but provides little benefit over vaccinating girls only.

Methods: In the Finnish Family {HPV} Study, 329 pregnant women were enrolled and followed up. {HPV}-genotyping of oral scrapings was performed with nested {PCR} and Multimetrix (R) test (Progen, Heidelberg, Germany). Incidence and clearance times and rates for each {HPV}-genotype identified in oral mucosa were determined. Predictors for incident and cleared {HPV} infections for species 7/9 genotypes were analyzed using Poisson regression model. Results: Altogether, 115 baseline {HPV}-negative women acquired incident oral {HPV} infection, and 79 women cleared their infection. {HPV}16 and multiple {HPVs} most frequently caused incident infections (65\% and 12\%) in 13.3 and 17.1 months respectively, followed by {HPV}58, {HPV}18 and {HPV}6 (close to 5\% each) in 11-24 months. {HPV}58, {HPV}18 and {HPV}66 were the most common to clear. {HPV}6 and {HPV}11 had the shortest clearance times, 4.6 months and 2.5 months, and the highest clearance rates, 225.5/1000 wmr and 400/1000 wmr, respectively. The protective factors for incident oral {HPV}-species 7/9 infections were 1) new pregnancy during follow-up and 2) having the same sexual partner during {FU}. Increased clearance was related with older age and a history of atopic reactions, whereas previous sexually transmitted disease and new pregnancy were associated with decreased clearance. Conclusions: {HPV}16 was the most frequent genotype to cause an incident oral {HPV}-infection. Low risk {HPV} genotypes cleared from oral mucosa more quickly than high risk {HPV} genotypes.

Prophylactic vaccines against oncogenic and warts-causing genital {HPV} types are currently under development and are expected to be available in the near future. This paper presents a two-sex, deterministic model for assessing the potential impact of a prophylactic {HPV} vaccine that has five biological modes of action: "take", "degree", "duration", "infectiousness", and "clearance". The model is based on the susceptible-infective-removed ({SIR}) compartmental structure. Important epidemiological thresholds such as the basic and vaccinated reproduction numbers and a measure of vaccine impact are derived. We find that if the vaccinated reproduction number is greater than unity, there is a locally unstable disease-free equilibrium and a unique endemic equilibrium. If the vaccinated reproduction number is less than unity, {HPV} will be eliminated. We use analytical and numerical methods to analyze the importance of various vaccine efficacy parameters as well as compare gender-specific and universal vaccination.},

	abstract = {Background: Current prophylactic vaccines against human papillomavirus ({HPV}) target two oncogenic types (16 and 18) that contribute to 70\% of cervical cancer cases worldwide. Our objective was to quantify the range of additional benefits conferred by second-generation {HPV} prophylactic vaccines that are expected to expand protection to five additional oncogenic types (31, 33, 45, 52 and 58). Methods: A microsimulation model of {HPV} and cervical cancer calibrated to epidemiological data from two countries (Kenya and Uganda) was used to estimate reductions in lifetime risk of cervical cancer from the second-generation {HPV} vaccines. We explored the independent and joint impact of uncertain factors (i. e., distribution of {HPV} types, co-infection with multiple {HPV} types, and unidentifiable {HPV} types in cancer) and vaccine properties (i. e., cross-protection against non-targeted {HPV} types), compared against currently-available vaccines. Results: Assuming complete uptake of the second-generation vaccine, reductions in lifetime cancer risk were 86.3\% in Kenya and 91.8\% in Uganda, representing an absolute increase in cervical cancer reduction of 26.1\% in Kenya and 17.9\% in Uganda, compared with complete uptake of current vaccines. The range of added benefits was 19.6\% to 29.1\% in Kenya and 14.0\% to 19.5\% in Uganda, depending on assumptions of cancers attributable to multiple {HPV} infections and unidentifiable {HPV} types. These effects were blunted in both countries when assuming vaccine cross-protection with both the current and second-generation vaccines. Conclusion: Second-generation {HPV} vaccines that protect against additional oncogenic {HPV} types have the potential to improve cervical cancer prevention. Co-infection with multiple {HPV} infections and unidentifiable {HPV} types can influence vaccine effectiveness, but the magnitude of effect may be moderated by vaccine cross-protective effects. These benefits must be weighed against the cost of the vaccines in future analyses.},

Main outcome measure Incremental cost effectiveness ratios for both vaccines and additional cost per dose for the quadrivalent vaccine to be equally cost effective as the bivalent vaccine. Results The bivalent vaccine needs to be cheaper than the quadrivalent vaccine to be equally cost effective, mainly because of its lack of protection against anogenital warts. The price difference per dose ranges from a median of 19 pound (interquartile range 12- pound 27) pound to 35 pound (27- pound 44) pound across scenarios about vaccine duration, cross protection, and end points prevented (assuming one quality adjusted life year ({QALY}) is valued at 30 pound 000 and both vaccines can prevent all types of {HPV} related cancers).

Improved understanding of the pathogenesis of infection and the availability of newer tests are changing the approach to screening and diagnosis. Molecular tests to detect {DNA} from the most common high-risk {HPVs} are {FDA} approved for use in conjunction with cytology in cervical cancer screening programs. More-specific tests that detect {RNA} from high-risk {HPV} types are now also available. The use of molecular tests as the primary screening tests is being adopted in some areas. Genotyping to identify {HPV}16 and -18 has a recommended role in triaging patients for colposcopy who are high-risk {HPV} positive but have normal cytology. There are currently no recommended screening methods for anal, vulvar, vaginal, penile, or oropharyngeal {HPV} infections. {HPV} testing has limited utility in patients at high risk for anal cancer, but p16 immunohistochemistry is recommended to clarify lesions in tissue biopsy specimens that show moderate dysplasia or precancer mimics. {HPV} testing is recommended for oropharyngeal squamous cell tumors as a prognostic indicator. Ongoing research will help to improve the content of future guidelines for screening and diagnostic testing.},

Comparative empirical data were obtained in 1996-2001 from a cohort study of female university students in Montreal, Canada. Female prevalence and frequency of sexual intercourse and condom use were set equal to those in the cohort. Simulations included 240 combinations of male prevalence, the relative risk for protected versus unprotected sex, and per-act transmission probabilities. Those that produced expected {HPV} incidence within the 95\% confidence interval observed in the cohort were selected. The observed 6-month cumulative incidence following acquisition of a new partner was 17.0\% (95\% confidence interval: 11.4, 23.0). Expected incidences consistent with those from cohort findings occurred in 54/240 simulations. The range of per-act transmission probabilities was 5-100\% (median, 40\%). Male {HPV} prevalence was the same as or greater than that for women in all consistent simulations. Varying condom effectiveness did not produce better-fitting data. This simulation suggests that {HPV} transmissibility is several-fold higher than that for other viral sexually transmitted infections such as human immunodeficiency virus or herpes simplex virus 2. With high transmissibility, any potential protective effect of condoms would disappear over multiple intercourse acts, underlining the need for an effective {HPV} vaccine.},

	abstract = {The prevailing lack of consensus about the comparative harms and benefits of cancer screening stems, in part, from the inappropriate calculations of the expected mortality impact of a sustained screening programme. There is an inherent, and often substantial, time lag from the time of screening until the resulting mortality reductions begin, reach their maximum and ultimately end. However, the cumulative mortality reduction reported in a randomised screening trial is typically calculated over an arbitrarily defined follow-up period, including follow-up time where the mortality impact is yet to realise or where it has already been exhausted. Because of this, the cumulative reduction cannot be used for projecting the mortality impact expected from a sustained screening programme. For this purpose, we propose a new measure, the time-specific probability of being helped by screening, given that the cancer would have proven fatal otherwise. This can be decomposed into round-specific impacts, which in turn can be parametrised and estimated from the trial data. This represents a major shift in quantifying the benefits due to a sustained screening programme, based on statistical evidence extracted from existing trial data. We illustrate our approach using data from screening trials in lung and colorectal cancers.},

	abstract = {A new two-group deterministic model for Chlamydia trachomatis, which stratifies the entire population based on risk of acquiring or transmitting infection, is designed and analyzed to gain insight into its transmission dynamics. The model is shown to exhibit the phenomenon of backward bifurcation, where a stable disease-free equilibrium ({DFE}) co-exists with one or more stable endemic equilibria when the associated reproduction number is less than unity. Unlike in some of the earlier modeling studies on Chlamydia transmission dynamics in a population, this study shows that the backward bifurcation phenomenon persists even if individuals who recovered from Chlamydia infection do not get re-infected. However, it is shown that the phenomenon can be removed if all the susceptible individuals are equally likely to acquire infection (i.e., for the case where the susceptible male and female populations are not stratified according to risk of acquiring infection). In such a case, the {DFE} of the resulting (reduced) model is globally-asymptotically stable when the associated reproduction number is less than unity and no re-infection of recovered individuals occurs. Thus, this study shows that stratifying the two-sex Chlamydia transmission model, presented in In according to the risk of acquiring or transmitting infection induces the phenomenon of backward bifurcation regardless of whether or not the re-infection of recovered individuals occurs.

We estimated the potential impact and cost-effectiveness of providing 3-doses of nonavalent human papillomavirus ({HPV}) vaccine (9vHPV) to females aged 13-18 years who had previously completed a series of quadrivalent {HPV} vaccine (4vHPV), a strategy we refer to as "additional 9vHPV vaccination." Methods. We used 2 distinct models: (1) the simplified model, which is among the most basic of the published dynamic {HPV} models, and (2) the {US} {HPV}-{ADVISE} model, a complex, stochastic, individual-based transmission-dynamic model. Results. When assuming no 4vHPV cross-protection, the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year ({QALY}) gained by additional 9vHPV vaccination was \$146 200 in the simplified model and \$108 200 in the {US} {HPV}-{ADVISE} model (\$191 800 when assuming 4vHPV cross-protection). In 1-way sensitivity analyses in the scenario of no 4vHPV cross-protection, the simplified model results ranged from \$70 300 to \$182 000, and the {US} {HPV}-{ADVISE} model results ranged from \$97 600 to \$118 900. Conclusions. The average cost per {QALY} gained by additional 9vHPV vaccination exceeded \$100 000 in both models. However, the results varied considerably in sensitivity and uncertainty analyses. Additional 9vHPV vaccination is likely not as efficient as many other potential {HPV} vaccination strategies, such as increasing primary 9vHPV vaccine coverage.},

	abstract = {Objective: To estimate the incidence and duration of cervical human papillomavirus ({HPV})-6, {HPV}-11, {HPV}-16, and {HPV}-18 infections in a population of young American women. Methods: The study population consisted of U.S. women who at baseline were 16 to 23 years of age, reported zero to five lifetime sexual partners, never having been pregnant, and never having had a prior abnormal Papanicolaou test and were enrolled in the placebo arm of a randomized multicenter clinical trial of a {HPV}-16 L1 virus-like particle vaccine. Women underwent type-specific endocervical/ectocervical swab {HPV} {DNA} testing at similar to 6-month intervals for up to 48 months of follow-up. To contribute persontime in the analyses of type-specific {HPV} incidence, a woman must have had at least three satisfactory swab specimens available and been negative for the relevant {HPV} type ({HPV}-6, {HPV}-11-, {HPV}-16, or {HPV}-18) on her first two trial swabs. The duration of incident {HPV} infections was estimated using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis methods. Results: Person-years of exposure ranged by type-specific analysis from 2,645 to 3,188, with an incidence rate per 100 person-years of 3.6 for {HPV}-6, 0.4 for {HPV}-11, 5.4 for {HPV}-16, and 2.1 for {HPV}-18. With censoring at the time of treatment for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, where done, the mean duration of incident infections was 9.3, 8.4, 18.2, and 16.4 months, respectively, for {HPV}-6 (n = 103), {HPV}-11 (n = 13), {HPV}-16 (n = 142), and {HPV}-18 (n = 62). When the duration of {HPV} infections was truncated at the time of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia detection (any grade), where applicable, mean duration figures were 8.4, 8.1, 14.0, and 15.1 months for {HPV}-6, {HPV}-11, {HPV}-16, and {HPV}-18 infections, respectively. Conclusions: Previous studies of the mean duration of cervical {HPV} infection have been based on prevalent infections and/or featured relatively short duration of follow-up. This study tested women for {HPV} infection over a period of up to 48 months and observed a mean duration of incident {HPV}-16/ {HPV}-18 infections approximately twice that of {HPV}-6/ {HPV}-11.},

	abstract = {The two main goals of modelling cancer screening are data analysis and evaluation. In data analysis, analytical-numerical statistical models are used to test hypotheses about preclinical disease, the screening test, and the association between early detection and risk of dying from the cancer. Evaluation in cancer screening is supported by model-based prediction of screening effects and cost-effectiveness. Simulation models are suitable for these tasks, and can also be used to identify efficient age-ranges and intervals between screening tests. Striking differences exist between screening models for cervical cancer and breast cancer, which are the two cancer types for which screening is common practice. The two main problems in cervical cancer screening are the proportion of progressive and regressive among screen-detected lesions, and the impact of screening on incidence and mortality. In breast cancer, regression is not (yet) a big issue, and the relationship between screening and mortality reduction has been demonstrated in randomized controlled trials (at least for women older than 50 years). The weakest link in current breast cancer models is the association between earliness of detection and improvement in prognosis. The modelling outcomes and their usefulness are decisively influenced by the data sets that were used in quantifying the model, and the subclassifications of the data that were considered. New or pending modelling issues include {HPV}-based screening in cervical cancer, screening models for colorectal cancer, the use of surrogate outcome measures and model-based meta-analysis of screening trials.},

Major advances in the understanding of cervical carcinogenesis motivate the creation of a new disease paradigm in such models. To keep pace with the most recent evidence, we updated a previously developed microsimulation model of human papillomavirus ({HPV}) infection and cervical cancer to reflect 1) a shift towards health states based on {HPV} rather than poorly reproducible histological diagnoses and 2) {HPV} clearance and progression to precancer as a function of infection duration and genotype, as derived from the control arm of the Costa Rica Vaccine Trial (2004-2010). The model was calibrated leveraging empirical data from the New Mexico Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Registry (1980-1999) and a state-of-the-art cervical cancer screening registry in New Mexico (2007-2009). The calibrated model had good correspondence with data on genotype-and age-specific {HPV} prevalence, genotype frequency in precancer and cancer, and age-specific cancer incidence. We present this model in response to a call for new natural history models of cervical cancer intended for decision analysis and economic evaluation at a time when global cervical cancer prevention policy continues to evolve and evidence of the long-term health effects of cervical interventions remains critical.},

Because most women in the general population are sexually active, some will have already been infected with {\textgreater}= 1 {HPV} vaccine types at the time vaccination is offered. Here, we assessed whether such infected women are protected against disease caused by the remaining {HPV} vaccine types. Methods. Two randomized, placebo-controlled trials of the quadrivalent (types 6, 11, 16, and 18) {HPV} vaccine enrolled 17,622 women without consideration of baseline {HPV} status.

Vaccination was 100\% effective (95\% confidence interval [{CI}], 79\%-100\%) in preventing incident cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2 or 3 or cervical adenocarcinoma in situ caused by the {HPV} type or types for which the women were negative at enrollment.

Qualitative and comprehensive mathematical techniques have been used to analyse the model. The gonorrhea-only and {HIV}-only sub-models are first considered. Analytic expressions for the threshold parameter in each sub-model and the co-interaction model are derived. Global dynamics of this co-interaction shows that whenever the threshold parameter for the respective sub-models and co-interaction model is less than unity, the epidemics dies out, while the reverse results in persistence of the epidemics in the community. The impact of gonorrhea and its treatment on {HIV} dynamics is also investigated. Numerical simulations using a set of reasonable parameter values show that the two epidemics co-exists whenever their reproduction numbers exceed unity (with no competitive exclusion). Further, simulations of the full {HIV}-gonorrhea model also suggests that an increase in the number of individuals infected with gonorrhea (either singly or dually with {HIV}) in the presence of treatment results in a decrease in gonorrhea-only cases, dual-infection cases but increases the number of {HIV}-only cases.

The life expectancy gains were consistently greater in the unadjusted model compared to the adjusted model (positive bias).

	abstract = {Background: We describe the incidence and duration of cervical human papillomavirus ({HPV}) infection episodes along with the risk of infection reappearance following a period of nondetection. Methods: Women (1,788) ages 16 to 23 years underwent cytologic testing and {PCR}-based testing of cervical swab samples for {HPV} {DNA} ({HPV}-16/18/31/33/35/45/52/58/59) at similar to 6-month intervals for up to 4 years in the context of a phase 3 clinical trial (placebo arm). {HPV} type-specific incidence rates were estimated per 100 person-years. Duration of type-specific cervical infection episodes and risk of reappearance following a period of nondetection were estimated using Kaplan-Meier methods. Results: {HPV}-16 exhibited the highest (5.9), and {HPV}-35 and {HPV}-33 exhibited the lowest (1.0) incidence rates per 100 person-years. Mean cervical infection durations ranged from 13 months for {HPV}-59 to 20 months for {HPV}-16 and 58 (with ongoing infections censored at the time of treatment, if done). The risk of cervical infection reappearance within similar to 3 years following a period of nondetection ranged from 0\% to 16\% across {HPV} types, with a mean of 8\%. Limited evidence was found for a role of false-positive {HPV} tests, missed infections that were above the threshold for detection, or new acquisition of infection in accounting for patterns of infection reappearance. Conclusions: Incidence of high-risk cervical infection was observed to vary considerably more across {HPV} types than infection duration. A nontrivial proportion of women exhibited infection reappearance following a period of nondetection, with a potential explanation for many such events observed within this analysis being a return to detectable levels of a previously acquired infection. Impact: The risk of {HPV} infection reappearance following a period of nondetection has not been previously reported for individual {HPV} types, and this study finds that a nontrivial proportion of infected women exhibit reappearances. Future studies could ascertain subject-level factors that potentially modify the risk of infection reappearance. Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev; 19(6); 1585-94. (C) 2010 {AACR}.},

	abstract = {Background Candidate human papillomavirus ({HPV}) vaccines have demonstrated almost 90\%-100\% efficacy in preventing persistent, type-specific {HPV} infection over 18 mo in clinical trials. If these vaccines go on to demonstrate prevention of precancerous lesions in phase {III} clinical trials, they will be licensed for public use in the near future. How these vaccines will be used in countries with national cervical cancer screening programmes is an important question. Methods and Findings We developed a transmission model of {HPV} 16 infection and progression to cervical cancer and calibrated it to Finnish {HPV} 16 seroprevalence over time. The model was used to estimate the transmission probability of the virus, to look at the effect of changes in patterns of sexual behaviour and smoking on age-specific trends in cancer incidence, and to explore the impact of {HPV} 16 vaccination. We estimated a high per-partnership transmission probability of {HPV} 16, of 0.6. The modelling analyses showed that changes in sexual behaviour and smoking accounted, in part, for the increase seen in cervical cancer incidence in 35- to 39-y-old women from 1990 to 1999. At both low (10\% in opportunistic immunisation) and high (90\% in a national immunisation programme) coverage of the adolescent population, vaccinating women and men had little benefit over vaccinating women alone. We estimate that vaccinating 90\% of young women before sexual debut has the potential to decrease {HPV} type-specific (e.g., type 16) cervical cancer incidence by 91\%. If older women are more likely to have persistent infections and progress to cancer, then vaccination with a duration of protection of less than 15 y could result in an older susceptible cohort and no decrease in cancer incidence. While vaccination has the potential to significantly reduce type-specific cancer incidence, its combination with screening further improves cancer prevention. Conclusions {HPV} vaccination has the potential to significantly decrease {HPV} type-specific cervical cancer incidence. High vaccine coverage of women alone, sustained over many decades, with a long duration of vaccine-conferred protection, would have the greatest impact on type-specific cancer incidence. This level of coverage could be achieved through national coordinated programmes, with surveillance to detect cancers caused by nonvaccine oncogenic {HPV} types.},

	abstract = {The Human Papillomavirus ({HPV}) is a sexually transmitted virus that causes cervical cancer. Since 2008 a vaccination program targeting 12-year-old girls has been initiated in Italy, backing up the cervical screening program already active since 1996. We propose a mathematical model of {HPV} transmission dynamics with the aim of evaluating the impact of these prevention strategies. The model considers heterosexual transmission of {HPV} types 16 and 18, structured by sex, age and sexual activity level, where transition to sexual activity is explicitly modeled from recent survey data. The epidemiological structure is a hybrid {SIS}/{SIR}, where a fraction of individuals recovering from infection develops permanent immunity against reinfection. Infections may progress to cervical lesions and cancer and heal spontaneously or upon treatment. Women undergoing hysterectomy (either after treatment of {HPV} lesions or by other causes) also transmit {HPV} infection. The model fits well both the age-specific prevalence of {HPV} infections and the incidence of cervical cancers in Italy, and accurately reproduces the decreasing trend in cancer incidence due to the introduction of the screening program. The model predicts that if the screening coverage is maintained at current levels, even in the absence of vaccination, such trend will continue in the next few decades, eventually plateauing at 25\% below the current level. The additional initiation of routine vaccination targeting 12-year-old girls will further reduce cervical cancer incidence by two thirds at equilibrium, under realistic assumptions of 70\% coverage and a duration of protective immunity of 50 years. If catch-up immunization of 25-year-old women at first cervical screening is also introduced, about 3,000 cervical cancer cases overall can be averted, corresponding to 9.6\% of all cases expected in the scenario without catch-up. We conclude that {HPV} vaccination in addition to cervical screening will significantly reduce the burden of cervical cancer in Italy.},

Using demographic, epidemiological, and cancer data from Brazil, we developed a dynamic transmission model of {HPV} infection between males and females. Model-projected reductions in {HPV} incidence under different vaccination scenarios were applied to a stochastic model of cervical carcinogenesis to project lifetime costs and benefits. We assumed vaccination prevented {HPV}-16 and -18 infections in individuals not previously infected, and protection was lifelong. Coverage was varied from 0-90\% in both genders, and cost per-vaccinated individual was varied from I\$25 to 400. At 90\% coverage, vaccinating girls alone reduced cancer risk by 63\%; including boys at this coverage level provided only 4\% further cancer reduction. At a cost per-vaccinated individual of \$50, vaccinating girls alone was {\textless}\$200 per year of life saved ({YLS}), while including boys ranged from \$810–18 650 per {YLS} depending on coverage. For all coverage levels, increasing coverage in girls was more effective and less costly than including boys in the vaccination programme. In a resource-constrained setting such as Brazil, our results support that the first priority in reducing cervical cancer mortality should be to vaccinate pre-adolescent girls.},

Furthermore, across the spectrum of cervical lesions, {HPV}-16 is consistently the most common {HPV} type contributing to 50-55\% of invasive cervical cancer cases strongly suggesting that this viral type has a biological advantage for transmission, persistency and transformation. The same phenomenon is observed albeit at a lower level for {HPV}-18 and {HPV}-45. Sexual behavioral patterns across age groups and populations are central to the description of the {HPV} circulation and of the risk of infection. The concept of group sexual behavior (in addition to individual sexual behavior) is important in exploring {HPV} transmission and has implications for defining and monitoring {HPV} and cancer prevention strategies. In natural history studies, the pattern of {HPV} {DNA} prevalence by age groups is similar to the patterns of {HPV} incidence. Rates of exposure in young women are high and often include multiple types. There is a spontaneous and rapid decrease of the {HPV} {DNA} detection rates in the middle-age groups followed by a second rise in the post-menopausal years.

The risk of detecting {CIN} associated with the same {HPV} type as the reference infection was analysed using Kaplan-Meier and multivariable Cox models. Infections were categorised depending upon persistence as 6-month persistent infection (6MPI) or infection of any duration. The 4-year interim analysis included 2,838 women, of whom 1,073 (37.8\%) experienced 2,615 infections of any duration and 708 (24.9\%) experienced 1,130 6MPIs. Infection with oncogenic {HPV} types significantly increased the risk of detecting {CIN} grade 2 or greater ({CIN}2+) versus non-oncogenic types. For 6MPI, the highest risk was associated with {HPV}-33 (hazard ratio [{HR}]: 31.9 [8.3-122.2, p{\textless}0.0001]). The next highest risk was with {HPV}-16 (21.1 [6.3-70.0], p{\textless}0.0001). Similar findings were seen for infections of any duration. Significant risk was also observed for {HPV}-18, {HPV}-31, and {HPV}-45. Concomitant {HPV} infection or {CIN} grade 1 or greater associated with a different oncogenic {HPV} type increased risk. Most women (79.3\%) with an {HPV} infection at baseline cleared detectable infections of any duration, and 69.9\% cleared a 6MPI. The risk of progression of {HPV} infection to {CIN}2+ in women {\textgreater}25 years in this study was similar to that in women 15-25 years in {PATRICIA}. What's New? Which {HPV} infections lead to cancer in women over 25 years? Most cervical cancer follows persistent oncogenic {HPV} infection, but most {HPV} infections clear naturally. Thus, to best predict patient outcomes, it's imperative to understand how {HPV} infections progress to {CINs}. This study confirmed that in women over 25 years, persistent infection with {HPV}-33 or {HPV}-16 meant the greatest chance of developing a {CINthe} same as was found in women 15-25 years, in an earlier analysis.},

	abstract = {Background
Mathematical models of tuberculosis ({TB}) transmission have been used to characterize disease dynamics, investigate the potential effects of public health interventions, and prioritize control measures. While previous work has addressed the mathematical description of {TB} natural history, the impact of demography on the behaviour of {TB} models has not been assessed. 
  
 Methods 
 A simple model of {TB} transmission, with alternative assumptions about survivorship, is used to explore the effect of age structure on the prevalence of infection, disease, basic reproductive ratio and the projected impact of control interventions. We focus our analytic arguments on the differences between constant and exponentially distributed lifespans and use an individual-based model to investigate the range of behaviour arising from realistic distributions of survivorship. 
  
 Results 
 The choice of age structure and natural (non-disease related) mortality strongly affects steady-state dynamics, parameter estimation and predictions about the effectiveness of control interventions. Since most individuals infected with {TB} develop an asymptomatic latent infection and never progress to active disease, we find that assuming a constant mortality rate results in a larger reproductive ratio and an overestimation of the effort required for disease control in comparison to using more realistic age-specific mortality rates. 
  
 Conclusions 
 Demographic modelling assumptions should be considered in the interpretation of models of chronic infectious diseases such as {TB}. For simple models, we find that assuming constant lifetimes, rather than exponential lifetimes, produces dynamics more representative of models with realistic age structure.},

	abstract = {A model is developed to describe the spread of {HIV} within heterosexual communities and the demographic impact of {AIDS}. The model combines epidemiologic and demographic processes and is designed to mirror the impact of {AIDS} in sub-Saharan Africa. Refinements on past work in this area include unequal probabilities for transmission from females to males and from males to females, the inclusion of an age- and sex-dependent sexual-partner choice function and distributed incubation plus infectious periods. Numerical studies suggest that unequal transmission probabilities (weighted to a greater probability from males to females than vice versa), and the tendency of males to choose sexual partners of the opposite sex younger than themselves, both act to increase the demographic impact of {AIDS} over that predicted with equal transmission between the sexes and partner choice restricted within given age classes. Analyses support the conclusions of past work that the epidemic will only have a small detrimental impact on the dependency ratio of a population (the ratio of dependents to working adults) even when a weighting is added to take account of the extra burden imposed by the care of adult {AIDS} patients. However, a small increase in the ratio can imply a significant rise in the number of dependents within the population. Stimulation studies of the impact of changes in behavior to reduce transmission highlight to the need to induce such changes as early as possible in the course of the epidemic in order to minimize its impact. Directions for future research are discussed emphasizing the need to acquire quantitative data on sexual habits and to construct models to represent heterogeneity in sexual behavior.},

	abstract = {Background: Randomized clinical trials have shown the 9-valent human papillomavirus ({HPV}) vaccine to be highly effective against types 31/33/45/52/58 compared with the 4-valent. Evidence on the added health and economic benefit of the 9-valent is required for policy decisions. We compare population-level effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of 9- and 4-valent {HPV} vaccination in the United States. Methods: We used a multitype individual-based transmission-dynamic model of {HPV} infection and disease (anogenital warts and cervical, anogenital, and oropharyngeal cancers), 3\% discount rate, and societal perspective. The model was calibrated to sexual behavior and epidemiologic data from the United States. In our base-case, we assumed 95\% vaccinetype efficacy, lifelong protection, and a cost/dose of \$145 and \$158 for the 4- and 9-valent vaccine, respectively. Predictions are presented using the mean (80\% uncertainty interval [{UI}] = 10th-90th percentiles) of simulations. Results: Under base-case assumptions, the 4-valent gender-neutral vaccination program is estimated to cost \$5500 (80\% {UI} = 2400-9400) and \$7300 (80\% {UI} = 4300-11 000)/quality-adjusted life-year ({QALY}) gained with and without cross-protection, respectively. Switching to a 9-valent gender-neutral program is estimated to be cost-saving irrespective of cross-protection assumptions. Finally, the incremental cost/{QALY} gained of switching to a 9-valent gender-neutral program (vs 9-valent girls/4-valent boys) is estimated to be \$140 200 (80\% {UI} = 4200-{\textgreater}1 million) and \$31 100 (80\% {UI} = 2100-{\textgreater}1 million) with and without cross-protection, respectively. Results are robust to assumptions about {HPV} natural history, screening methods, duration of protection, and healthcare costs. Conclusions: Switching to a 9-valent gender-neutral {HPV} vaccination program is likely to be cost-saving if the additional cost/dose of the 9-valent is less than \$13. Giving females the 9-valent vaccine provides the majority of benefits of a gender-neutral strategy.},

	abstract = {The anogenital human papillomavirus ({HPV}) is estimated to be the most commonly occurring sexually transmitted infection in the {US}. Comprehensive estimates of the annual economic burden associated with the prevention and treatment of anogenital {HPV}-related disease in the {US} population are currently unavailable. The purpose of this paper is to (i) outline an analytic framework from which to estimate the annual economic burden of preventing and treating anogenital {HPV}-related disease in the {US}; (ii) review available {US} literature concerning the annual economic burden of {HPV}; and (iii) highlight gaps in current knowledge where further study is particularly warranted. Among eight {US} studies identified that describe the annual economic burden pertaining to one or more aspects of anogenital {HPV}-related disease, three met the review eligibility criteria (published between 1990 and 2004, examined multiple facets of annual anogenital {HPV}-related economic burden, and clearly articulated the data and methods used in the estimation process). All costs were adjusted to 2004 \${US}. Estimates of the annual direct medical costs associated with cervical cancer were comparable across studies (range \${US}300-400 million). In contrast, there was a wide range across studies for estimates of the annual direct medical costs associated with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (range \${US}700 million-\${US}2.3 billion). Only one study reported direct medical costs for anogenital warts (\${US}200 million) and routine cervical cancer screening (\${US}2.3 billion). No studies examined direct medical costs attributable to {HPV}-related anal, penile, vaginal or vulvar cancers, or the work and productivity losses resulting from time spent receiving medical care, morbidity or mortality. Current economic burden estimates would suggest annual direct medical costs associated with the prevention and treatment of anogenital warts and cervical {HPV}-related disease of at least \${US}4 billion. This figure would likely rise to at least \${US}5 billion per year if direct medical costs associated with other disease entities caused by the sexual transmission of {HPV} were included, with further additions to the economic burden totalling in the billions of dollars if work and productivity losses were incorporated, a research priority for future studies.},

	abstract = {The authors constructed a Markov model as part of a systematic review of cervical cytology conducted at the Duke University Evidence-based Practice Center (Durham, North Carolina) between October 1997 and September 1998. The model incorporated states for human papillomavirus infection ({HPV}), low- and high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions, and cervical cancer stages I-{IV} to simulate the natural history of {HPV} infection in a cohort of women from ages 15 to 85 years. The age-specific incidence rate of {HPV}, and regression and progression rates of {HPV} and squamous intraepithelial lesions, were obtained from the literature. The effects of varying natural history parameters on cervical cancer incidence were evaluated by using sensitivity analysis. The base-case model resulted in a lifetime cervical cancer risk of 3.67\% and a lifetime cervical cancer mortality risk of 1.26\%, with a peak incidence of 81/100,000 at age 50 years. Age-specific distributions of precursors were similar to reported data. Lifetime risk of cancer was most sensitive to the incidence of {HPV} and the probability of rapid {HPV} progression to high-grade lesions (two- to threefold variations in risk). The model approximates the age-specific incidence of cervical cancer and provides a tool for evaluating the natural history of {HPV} infection and cervical cancer carcinogenesis as well as the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of primary and secondary prevention strategies.},

We investigated outcomes of 800 carcinogenic {HPV} infections detected in 599 women at enrollment into a population-based cohort (Guanacaste, Costa Rica). For individual infections, we calculated cumulative proportions of three outcomes (viral clearance, persistence without cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or worse [{CIN}2+], or persistence with new diagnosis of {CIN}2+) at successive 6-month time points for the first 30 months of follow-up. Cervical specimens were tested for carcinogenic {HPV} genotypes using an L1 degenerate-primer polymerase chain reaction method. Infections typically cleared rapidly, with 67\% (95\% confidence interval [{CI}] = 63\% to 70\%) clearing by 12 months. However, among infections that persisted at least 12 months, the risk of {CIN}2+ diagnosis by 30 months was 21\% (95\% {CI} = 15\% to 28\%). The risk of {CIN}2+ diagnosis was highest among women younger than 30 years with {HPV}-16 infections that persisted for at least 12 months (53\%; 95\% {CI} = 29\% to 76\%). These findings suggest that the medical community should emphasize persistence of cervical {HPV} infection, not single-time detection of {HPV}, in management strategies and health messages.},

	abstract = {To assess the impact of screening programmes in reducing the prevalence of Chlamydia trachomatis, mathematical and computational models are used as a guideline for decision support. Unfortunately, large uncertainties exist about the parameters that determine the transmission dynamics of C. trachomatis. Here, we use a {SEIRS} (susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered-susceptible) model to critically analyze the turnover of C. trachomatis in a population and the impact of a screening programme. We perform a sensitivity analysis on the most important steps during an infection with C. trachomatis. Varying the fraction of the infections becoming symptomatic as well as the duration of the symptomatic period within the range of previously used parameter estimates has little effect on the transmission dynamics. However, uncertainties in the duration of temporary immunity and the asymptomatic period can result in large differences in the predicted impact of a screening programme. We therefore analyze previously published data on the persistence of asymptomatic C. trachomatis infection in women and estimate the mean duration of the asymptomatic period to be longer than anticipated so far, namely 433 days (95\% {CI}: 420-447 days). Our study shows that a longer duration of the asymptomatic period results in a more pronounced impact of a screening programme. However, due to the slower turnover of the infection, a substantial reduction in prevalence can only be achieved after screening for several years or decades. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

This elevated risk persists across age groups and reflects biological and behavioral factors; yet, there have been few direct comparisons of sexual behavior patterns between these populations. Methods: We compared sexual behavior patterns of {MSM} and male and female heterosexuals aged 18-39 using 4 population-based random digit dialing surveys. A 1996-1998 survey in 4 {US} cities and 2 Seattle surveys (2003 and 2006) provided estimates for {MSM}; a 2003-2004 Seattle survey provided data about heterosexual men and women. Results: Sexual debut occurred earlier among {MSM} than heterosexuals. {MSM} reported longer cumulative lifetime periods of new partner acquisition than heterosexuals and a more gradual decline in new partnership formation with age. Among {MSM}, 86\% of 18- to 24-year-olds and 72\% of 35- to 39-year-olds formed a new partnership during the previous year, compared with 56\% of heterosexual men and 34\% of women at 18-24 years, and 21\% and 10\%, respectively, at 35-39 years. {MSM} were also more likely to choose partners {\textgreater}5 years older and were 2-3 times as likely as heterosexuals to report recent concurrent partnerships. {MSM} reported more consistent condom use during anal sex than heterosexuals reported during vaginal sex. Conclusions: {MSM} have longer periods of partnership acquisition, a higher prevalence of partnership concurrency, and more age disassortative mixing than heterosexuals.

The payoff time framework has been proposed (i.e., do not apply a guideline if a patient’s life expectancy ({LE}) is shorter than when a guideline’s cumulative incremental benefits first exceed its cumulative incremental harms), but its health impact is unclear. Objective: To investigate whether the payoff time framework improves {LE} and/or quality-adjusted life-years ({QALY}) for chronically ill patients. Methods: I evaluate impact of the payoff time framework on {LE} and {QALYs}, assuming (1) high and constant background mortality rate from chronic illness (≥ 10\% per year), (2) immediate guideline-related harm with probability {\textless} 1, and (3) constant guideline-related benefit that occurs over an extended time. I apply the framework to questions of whether to screen chronically ill 50-year-old women for colorectal cancer using colonoscopy, and whether to advocate intensive glucose control for chronically ill diabetics. Results: If a guideline’s payoff time is greater than a patient’s {LE}, then withholding that guideline will increase {LE} and {QALYs} for that patient. For a 50-year-old chronically ill woman with background mortality {\textgreater} 0.15 per year (corresponding to {LE} {\textless} 6.5 years), withholding {CR} screening will increase {LE}. For a diabetic with background mortality {\textgreater} 0.11 per year (corresponding to {LE} {\textless} 9.4 years), withholding {CR} screening will increase {QALYs}.

	abstract = {Objectives
Genital {HPV} infection in men causes benign and cancerous lesions, the incidence of which differs by age. The goal of this work was to comprehensively evaluate incidence and clearance of individual {HPV} genotypes among men by age group.
Methods
{HIV}-negative men ages 18–70 with no history of anogenital cancer were recruited for the {HPV} Infection in Men ({HIM}) Study. Participants completed clinical exams and questionnaires every six months for up to {\textasciitilde}4 years. Genital specimens underwent {HPV} genotyping, with associations between age and {HPV} assessed using Cox analyses.
Results
4085 men were followed for a median of 48.6 months (range: 0.3–94.0). Significantly lower {HPV} incidence rates were observed among the oldest age group (55–70 years) for grouped high-risk (incidence rate ratio [{IRR}]=0.71), {HPV}16 ({IRR}=0.54), grouped low-risk ({IRR}=0.74), and {HPV}6 ({IRR}=0.57) infections compared to men ages 18–24. However, incidence of the grouped 9-valent {HPV} vaccine types remained constant across the lifespan. Likelihood of {HPV}6 and {HPV}16 clearance remained constant until age 54, then increased significantly for men ages 55–70 (adjusted hazard ratio [{AHR}]=1.92 and 1.65, respectively).
Conclusions
Men remain susceptible to {HPV} infections throughout their lifespan, highlighting the need for prevention efforts with long-lasting duration.},

	abstract = {Background A vaccine targeting human papillomavirus ({HPV}) types 16 and 18, which are associated with 80\% of anal cancers, is efficacious in men. High-risk populations such as men who have sex with men ({MSM}) might especially benefit from vaccination. I aimed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of {HPV} vaccination of {MSM} in the {USA}. Methods I constructed decision-analytic models to estimate the direct health and economic outcomes of {HPV} vaccination (against types 6, 11, 16, and 18) for prevention of {HPV}-related anal cancer and genital warts. The model parameters that were varied were age at vaccination (12 years, 20 years, and 26 years), previous exposure to vaccine-targeted {HPV} types, and prevalence of {HIV}-1. I used the models to conduct sensitivity analyses, including duration of vaccine protection, vaccine cost, and burden of anal cancer and genital warts. Findings In a scenario of {HPV} vaccination of {MSM} at 12 years of age without previous exposure to {HPV}, compared with no vaccination, vaccination cost {US}\$15 290 per quality-adjusted life-year gained. In scenarios where {MSM} are vaccinated at 20 years or 26 years of age, after exposure to {HPV} infections, the cost-effectiveness ratios worsened, but were less than \$50 000 per quality-adjusted life-year under most scenarios. For example, {HPV} vaccination of {MSM} at 26 years cost \$37 830 per quality-adjusted life-year when previous exposure to all vaccine-targeted {HPV} types was assumed to be 50\%. Outcomes were most sensitive to variations in anal cancer incidence, duration of vaccine protection, and {HIV} prevalence in {MSM}. Interpretation {HPV} vaccination of {MSM} is likely to be a cost-effective intervention for the prevention of genital warts and anal cancer.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.juro.2014.08.002},
	abstract = {Purpose
Prostate specific antigen sensitivity increases with lower threshold values but with a corresponding decrease in specificity. Magnetic resonance imaging/ultrasound targeted biopsy detects prostate cancer more efficiently and of higher grade than standard 12-core transrectal ultrasound biopsy but the optimal population for its use is not well defined. We evaluated the performance of magnetic resonance imaging/ultrasound targeted biopsy vs 12-core biopsy across a prostate specific antigen continuum.

Materials and Methods
We reviewed the records of all patients enrolled in a prospective trial who underwent 12-core transrectal ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging/ultrasound targeted biopsies from August 2007 through February 2014. Patients were stratified by each of 4 prostate specific antigen cutoffs. The greatest Gleason score using either biopsy method was compared in and across groups as well as across the population prostate specific antigen range. Clinically significant prostate cancer was defined as Gleason 7 (4 + 3) or greater. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed.

Results
A total of 1,003 targeted and 12-core transrectal ultrasound biopsies were performed, of which 564 diagnosed prostate cancer for a 56.2\% detection rate. Targeted biopsy led to significantly more upgrading to clinically significant disease compared to 12-core biopsy. This trend increased more with increasing prostate specific antigen, specifically in patients with prostate specific antigen 4 to 10 and greater than 10 ng/ml. Prostate specific antigen 5.2 ng/ml or greater captured 90\% of upgrading by targeted biopsy, corresponding to 64\% of patients who underwent multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging and subsequent fusion biopsy. Conversely a greater proportion of clinically insignificant disease was detected by 12-core vs targeted biopsy overall. These differences persisted when controlling for potential confounders on multivariate analysis.

Conclusions
Prostate cancer upgrading with targeted biopsy increases with an increasing prostate specific antigen cutoff. Above a prostate specific antigen threshold of 5.2 ng/ml most upgrading to clinically significant disease was achieved by targeted biopsy. In our population this corresponded to potentially sparing biopsy in 36\% of patients who underwent multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging. Below this value 12-core biopsy detected more clinically insignificant cancer. Thus, the diagnostic usefulness of targeted biopsy is optimized in patients with prostate specific antigen 5.2 ng/ml or greater.},

	abstract = {Background Mathematical modelling of infectious diseases transmitted by the respiratory or close-contact route ( e. g., pandemic influenza) is increasingly being used to determine the impact of possible interventions. Although mixing patterns are known to be crucial determinants for model outcome, researchers often rely on a priori contact assumptions with little or no empirical basis. We conducted a population- based prospective survey of mixing patterns in eight European countries using a common paper- diary methodology. Methods and Findings 7,290 participants recorded characteristics of 97,904 contacts with different individuals during one day, including age, sex, location, duration, frequency, and occurrence of physical contact. We found that mixing patterns and contact characteristics were remarkably similar across different European countries. Contact patterns were highly assortative with age: schoolchildren and young adults in particular tended to mix with people of the same age. Contacts lasting at least one hour or occurring on a daily basis mostly involved physical contact, while short duration and infrequent contacts tended to be nonphysical. Contacts at home, school, or leisure were more likely to be physical than contacts at the workplace or while travelling. Preliminary modelling indicates that 5- to 19-year-olds are expected to suffer the highest incidence during the initial epidemic phase of an emerging infection transmitted through social contacts measured here when the population is completely susceptible. Conclusions To our knowledge, our study provides the first large-scale quantitative approach to contact patterns relevant for infections transmitted by the respiratory or close-contact route, and the results should lead to improved parameterisation of mathematical models used to design control strategies.},

External parties such as health authorities are increasingly requiring submission of the actual model, often in order to test the robustness of the outcomes of the model by performing additional sensitivity analyses. The objective of this work was to develop an alternative method to capture the critical issues of a sensitivity analysis in a health economic model, especially regarding the selection of variables and determining the range for each variable. Apart from external parties such as health authorities, journal readers who want to perform their own sensitivity analysis but do not have access to the model may find this useful. Methods and Results: Statistical methods based on Markov chain modeling and regression analysis, using the framework of the Taylor series expansion around a point, are used to derive an equation for 1-way sensitivity analyses. In particular, equations for costs and effects are being developed, from which the cost-effectiveness ratio is built. The article shows the feasibility of such equations for the execution of 1-way sensitivity analyses. Conclusion: An equation that can be derived in the manner described in this article provides a substantial amount of information. The inclusion of such an equation in a report may increase transparency of the reporting of outcomes of health economic models.},

	abstract = {Context Recently published results suggest that effective vaccines against cervical cancer-associated human papillomavirus ({HPV}) may become available within the next decade. Objective To examine the potential health and economic effects of an {HPV} vaccine in a setting of existing screening. Design, Setting, and Population A Markov model was used to estimate the lifetime (age 12-85 years) costs and life expectancy of a hypothetical cohort of women screened for cervical cancer in the United States. Three strategies were compared: (1) vaccination only; (2) conventional cytological screening only; and (3) vaccination followed by screening. Two of the strategies incorporated a vaccine targeted against a defined proportion of high-risk (oncogenic) {HPV} types. Screening intervals of 1, 2, 3, and 5 years and starting ages for screening of 18, 22, 24, 26, and 30 years were chosen for 2 of the strategies (conventional cytological screening only and vaccination followed by screening). Main Outcome Measures Incremental cost per life-year gained. Results Vaccination only or adding vaccination to screening conducted every 3 and 5 years was not cost-effective. However, at more frequent screening intervals, strategies combining vaccination and screening were preferred. Vaccination plus biennial screening delayed until age 24 years had the most attractive cost-effectiveness ratio (\$44889) compared with screening only beginning at age 18 years and conducted every 3 years. However, the strategy of vaccination with annual screening beginning at age 18 years had the largest overall reduction in cancer incidence and mortality at a cost of \$236250 per life-year gained compared with vaccination and annual screening beginning at age 22 years. The cost-effectiveness of vaccination plus delayed screening was highly sensitive to age of vaccination, duration of vaccine efficacy, and cost of vaccination. Conclusions Vaccination for {HPV} in combination with screening can be a cost-effective health intervention, but it depends on maintaining effectiveness during the ages of peak oncogenic {HPV} incidence. Identifying the optimal age for vaccination should be a top research priority.},

	abstract = {Context: Researchers have examined the age of partners of young women at first intercourse and of young women who have given birth, but little is known about the age of partners of young women in current sexual relationships or young women who have had an abortion. Methods: Data from the 1995 National Survey of Family Growth ({NSFG}) were used to examine age differences between women and their current partner and women's use of contraceptives at last intercourse, by marital status and by the age difference between women and their partner. Data from the {NSFG} and the 1994-1995 Alan Guttmacher Institute Abortion Patient Survey, with supplemental information from other sources, were used to estimate 1994 pregnancy rates for women by their age and marital status, according to the age difference between the women and their partner. Results: Among all sexually active women aged 15-44, 10\% had a partner who was three or more years younger, 52\% a partner who was within two years of their age, 20\% a partner who was 3-5 years older, and 18\% a partner who was six or more years older. In contrast, 64\% of sexually active women aged 15-17 had a partner within two years of their age, 29\% a partner who was 3-5 years older, and 7\% a partner who was six or more years older. Among women younger than 18, the pregnancy rate among those with a partner who was six or more years older was 3.7 times as high as the rate among those whose partner was no more than two years older. Among women younger than 18 who became pregnant, those with a partner who was six or more years older were less likely to have an unintended pregnancy (70\%) or to terminate an unintended pregnancy (21\%) than were those whose partner was no more than two years older (82\% and 49\%, respectively). Among women younger than 18 who were at risk of unintended pregnancy, 66\% of those who had a partner who was six or more years older had practiced contraception at last sex, compared with 78\% of those with a partner within two years of their own age. Young women who were Catholic and those who had first had sex with their partner within a relatively committed relationship were less likely to be involved with a man who was six or more years older than were young women who were Protestants and those who first had sex with their partner when they were dating, friends or had just met. Young women who had ever been forced to have sex were twice as likely as those who had not to have a partner who was 3-5 years older. Conclusion: Although the proportion of 15-17-year-old women who have a much older partner is small, these adolescents are of concern because of their low rate of contraceptive use and their relatively high rates of pregnancy and birth. Research is needed to determine why some young women have relationships with an older man, and how their partner's characteristics affect their reproductive behavior.},

Unfortunately, {PrEP} is not reimbursed in most European countries. Cost-effectiveness analyses of {PrEP} among {MSM} in Europe are absent but are key for decision makers to decide upon {PrEP} implementation.
{METHODS}: We developed a deterministic mathematical model, calibrated to the well defined Dutch {HIV} epidemic among {MSM}, to predict the effect and cost-effectiveness of {PrEP}. {PrEP} was targeted to 10\% of highly sexually active Dutch {MSM} over the coming 40 years. Cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated to predict the cost-effectiveness of daily and on-demand {PrEP}. Cost-effectiveness ratios below €20 000 were considered to be cost-effective in this analysis.
{FINDINGS}: Within the context of a stable {HIV} epidemic, at 80\% effectiveness and current {PrEP} pricing, {PrEP} can cost as much as €11 000 ({IQR} 9400-14 100) per quality-adjusted life-year ({QALY}) gained when used daily, or as little as €2000 ({IQR} 1300-3000) per {QALY} gained when used on demand. At 80\% effectiveness, daily {PrEP} can be considered cost-saving if the price of {PrEP} is reduced by 70\%, and on-demand {PrEP} can be considered cost-saving if the price is reduced by 30-40\%.
{INTERPRETATION}: {PrEP} for {HIV} prevention among {MSM} in the Netherlands is cost-effective. The use of {PrEP} is most cost-effective when the price of {PrEP} is reduced through on-demand use or through availability of generic {PrEP}, and can quickly be considered cost-saving.

	abstract = {Background. Preexposure prophylaxis ({PrEP}) is effective for preventing human immunodeficiency virus ({HIV}) infection among men who have sex with men ({MSM}) within trial settings. Population impact will depend on clinical indications for {PrEP} initiation, coverage levels, and drug adherence. No modeling studies have estimated the impact of clinical practice guidelines for {PrEP} issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ({CDC}).
Methods. Mathematical models of {HIV} transmission among {MSM} were used to estimate the percentage of infections averted ({PIA}) and the number needed to treat ({NNT}) under behavioral indications of the {CDC}'s {PrEP} guidelines. We modeled the contribution of these indications while varying treatment coverage and adherence.
Results. At 40\% coverage of indicated {MSM} over the next decade, application of {CDC} guidelines would avert 1162 infections per 100 000 person-years, 33.0\% of expected infections. The predicted {NNT} for the guidelines would be 25. Increasing coverage and adherence jointly raise the {PIA}, but reductions to the {NNT} were associated with better adherence only.
Conclusions. Implementation of {CDC} {PrEP} guidelines would result in strong and sustained reductions in {HIV} incidence among {MSM} in the United States. The guidelines strike a good balance between epidemiological impact ({PIA}) and efficiency ({NNT}) at plausible scale-up levels. Adherence counseling could maximize public health investment in {PrEP} by decreasing the {NNT}.},

Genital high-risk {HPV} {DNA} was measured using liquid hybridization and polymerase chain reaction assays. Serum antibodies to {HPV} subtypes 16 and 18 were measured using a multiplexed competitive luminex technique. {RESULTS}: The prevalence of genital high-risk {HPV} was 12.6\% among Korean women aged 20-59 years. It reached a peak of 23.2\% at 20-29 years of age, decreasing thereafter but increasing again to 12.4\% at 50-59 years of age. Human papillomavirus 56 was the most common subtype followed by {HPV} 18, {HPV} 52, and {HPV} 16. The seroprevalence of {HPV} subtypes 16 and 18 was 8.7\% among Korean girls and women aged 9-59 years. It reached its highest peak of 13.4\% at 25-29 years of age and decreased thereafter. It then reached a second peak of 10.9\% at 40-49 years of age and plateaued thereafter. The seroprevalences of {HPV} sub-types 16 and 18 were 7.4\% and 2.7\%, respectively. In multivariable analysis, the prevalence and seroprevalence of high-risk {HPV} were correlated only with the number of lifetime sexual partners. {CONCLUSION}: High-risk {HPV} infection is common among Korean women. Our epidemiological data on high-risk {HPV} infection will help to assess vaccine policy and to establish a baseline for estimating vaccine efficacy. (Obstet Gynecol 2010;116:932-40)},

	abstract = {Background Sexually transmitted infection ({STI}) risk is determined both by partner numbers and partnership characteristics. Studies describing only recent partnership(s) overestimate long-term partnerships and underestimate the contribution of casual partnerships to {STI} transmission in populations. We describe all heterosexual partnerships in the past year in terms of partnership type, age and geographical mixing and how these characteristics relate to condom use.
Methods Probability sample survey of 11 161 men and women aged 16–44 resident in Britain, 1999–2001. Computer-assisted self-interviews asked respondents about partner numbers and detailed questions about their three most recent partnerships. We weight these data to represent partnerships for which detailed questions were not asked to present estimates for the population of partnerships.
Results Of 15 488 heterosexuals partnerships, 39.1\% (95\% {CI} 36.6–41.7\%) of men's partnerships were ‘not (yet) regular’ vs 20.0\% (95\% {CI} 18.2–21.9\%) of women's partnerships. While condoms were used at last sex in 37.1\% (95\% {CI} 35.0–39.3\%) of men's and 28.8\% (95\% {CI} 27.1–30.6\%) of women's partnerships, and for 55.3\% (95\% {CI} 52.6–58.0\%) of first sex with new partners, these proportions declined with age. When partnerships involved an age difference of 5+ years [26.2\% (95\% {CI} 23.0–29.6\%) of men's and 36.5\% (95\% {CI} 33.0–40.1\%) of women's partnerships], condoms were less commonly used at first sex than when partners were closer in age [44.1\% (95\% {CI} 39.1–48.4\%) vs 60.8\% (95\% {CI} 57.3–64.2\%)]. Sex occurred within 24 h in 23.4\% (95\% {CI} 19.7–27.5\%) of men's and 10.7\% (95\% {CI} 8.3–13.6\%) of women's partnerships.
Conclusions A substantial minority of partnerships in the population is casual. The proportion of partnerships not protected by condoms is high, especially for partnerships involving larger age differences and people in their 30s and 40s. Condom use with new partners needs to be promoted among all age-groups.},

	abstract = {Nonrandom mixing can significantly alter the diffusion path of an infectious disease such as {AIDS} that requires intimate contact. Recent attempts to model this effect have sought a general framework capable of representing both simple and arbitrarily complicated mixing structures, and of solving the balancing problem in a nonequilibrium multigroup population. Log-linear models are proposed here as a general framework for solving the first problem. This approach offers several additional benefits: The parameters used to govern the mixing have a simple, intuitive interpretation, the framework provides a statistically sound basis for the estimation of these parameters from mixing-matrix data, and the resulting estimates are easily integrated into compartmental models for diffusion. A modified selection model is proposed to solve the second problem of generalizing the selection process to nonequilibrium populations. The distribution of contacts under this model is derived and is found to satisfy the assumptions of statistical inference for log-linear models. Together these techniques provide an integrated and flexible framework for modeling the role of selective mixing in the spread of disease.},

	abstract = {{IMPORTANCE} Prostate cancer screening with the prostate-specific antigen ({PSA}) test remains controversial. {OBJECTIVE} To review evidence from randomized trials and related modeling studies examining the effect of {PSA} screening vs no screening on prostate cancer-specific mortality and to suggest an approach balancing potential benefits and harms. {EVIDENCE} {ACQUISITION} {MEDLINE}, {EMBASE}, and the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials were searched from January 1, 2010, to April 3, 2013, for {PSA} screening trials to update a previous systematic review. Another search was performed in {EMBASE} and {MEDLINE} to identify modeling studies extending the results of the 2 large randomized trials identified. The American Heart Association Evidence-Based Scoring System was used to rate level of evidence. {RESULTS} Two trials-the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian ({PLCO}) screening trial and the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer ({ERSPC})-dominate the evidence regarding {PSA} screening. The former trial demonstrated an increase in cancer incidence in the screening group (relative risk [{RR}], 1.12; 95\% {CI}, 1.07-1.17) but no cancer-specific mortality benefit to {PSA} screening after 13-year follow-up ({RR}, 1.09; 95\% {CI}, 0.87-1.36). The {ERSPC} demonstrated an increase in cancer incidence with screening ({RR}, 1.63; 95\% {CI}, 1.57-1.69) and an improvement in the risk of prostate cancer-specific death after 11 years ({RR}, 0.79; 95\% {CI}, 0.68-0.91). The {ERSPC} documented that 37 additional men needed to receive a diagnosis through screening for every 1 fewer prostate cancer death after 11 years of follow-up among men aged 55 to 69 years (level B evidence for prostate cancer mortality reduction). Harms associated with screening include false-positive results and complications of biopsy and treatment. Modeling studies suggest that this high ratio of additional men receiving diagnoses to prostate cancer deaths prevented will decrease during a longer follow-up (level B evidence). {CONCLUSIONS} {AND} {RELEVANCE} Available evidence favors clinician discussion of the pros and cons of {PSA} screening with average-risk men aged 55 to 69 years. Only men who express a definite preference for screening should have {PSA} testing. Other strategies to mitigate the potential harms of screening include considering biennial screening, a higher {PSA} threshold for biopsy, and conservative therapy for men receiving a new diagnosis of prostate cancer.},

	abstract = {Objectives The objective of this study was to determine the optimal time interval for a repeated Chlamydia trachomatis (chlamydia) test. Methods The authors used claims data for {US} women aged 15-25 years who were enrolled in commercial health insurance plans in the {MarketScan} database between 2002 and 2006. The authors determined the numbers of initial positive and negative tests that were followed by a repeated test and the positivity of repeated tests. The authors used a dynamic transmission pair model that reflects the partnership formation and separation processes in 15-25 year olds to determine the time course of repeated infections in women under different levels of notifying the current partner. The authors then explored the additional impact of repeated testing uptake on reducing chlamydia prevalence. Results 40\% (4949/12 413) of positive tests were followed by a repeated test compared with 22\% (89 119/402 659) of negative tests at any time. Positivity of repeated tests followed by an initial positive test was high: 15\% (736) after a positive test versus 3\% (2886) after a negative test. The transmission model showed a peak in repeated infections between 2 and 5 months after treatment. For a chlamydia testing uptake of 10\% per year, the additional impact of repeated testing on reducing chlamydia population prevalence was modest. Conclusions The mathematical model predictions support the recommended interval for repeat chlamydia testing. This study provides information that can be used to design randomised controlled trials to determine more effective interventions to prevent chlamydial reinfection.},

We conducted a noninferiority immunogenicity study to bridge the findings in young women to girls and boys aged 9 to 15 years. {METHODS}: Subjects (N = 3066) received a 3-dose regimen of 9vHPV vaccine administered at day 1, month 2, and month 6. Anti-{HPV} serologic assays were performed at day 1 and month 7. Noninferiority required that the lower bound of 2-sided 95\% confidence intervals of geometric mean titer ratios (boys: young women or girls: young women) be {\textgreater}0.67 for each {HPV} type. Systemic and injection-site adverse experiences ({AEs}) and serious {AEs} were monitored. {RESULTS}: At 4 weeks after dose 3, {\textgreater}99\% of girls, boys, and young women seroconverted for each vaccine {HPV} type. Increases in geometric mean titers to {HPV} types 6/11/16/18/31/33/45/52/58 were elicited in all vaccine groups. Responses in girls and boys were noninferior to those of young women.

	abstract = {Background: The cost-effectiveness of prophylactic vaccination against human papillomavirus types 16 ({HPV}-16) and 18 ({HPV}-18) is an important consideration for guidelines for immunization in the United States. Methods: We synthesized epidemiologic and demographic data using models of {HPV}-16 and {HPV}-18 transmission and cervical carcinogenesis to compare the health and economic outcomes of vaccinating preadolescent girls (at 12 years of age) and vaccinating older girls and women in catch-up programs (to 18, 21, or 26 years of age). We examined the health benefits of averting other {HPV}-16-related and {HPV}-18-related cancers, the prevention of {HPV}-6-related and {HPV}-11-related genital warts and juvenile-onset recurrent respiratory papillomatosis by means of the quadrivalent vaccine, the duration of immunity, and future screening practices. Results: On the assumption that the vaccine provided lifelong immunity, the cost-effectiveness ratio of vaccination of 12-year-old girls was \$43,600 per quality-adjusted life-year ({QALY}) gained, as compared with the current screening practice. Under baseline assumptions, the cost-effectiveness ratio for extending a temporary catch-up program for girls to 18 years of age was \$97,300 per {QALY}; the cost of extending vaccination of girls and women to the age of 21 years was \$120,400 per {QALY}, and the cost for extension to the age of 26 years was \$152,700 per {QALY}. The results were sensitive to the duration of vaccine-induced immunity; if immunity waned after 10 years, the cost of vaccination of preadolescent girls exceeded \$140,000 per {QALY}, and catch-up strategies were less cost-effective than screening alone. The cost-effectiveness ratios for vaccination strategies were more favorable if the benefits of averting other health conditions were included or if screening was delayed and performed at less frequent intervals and with more sensitive tests; they were less favorable if vaccinated girls were preferentially screened more frequently in adulthood. Conclusions: The cost-effectiveness of {HPV} vaccination will depend on the duration of vaccine immunity and will be optimized by achieving high coverage in preadolescent girls, targeting initial catch-up efforts to women up to 18 or 21 years of age, and revising screening policies.},

	abstract = {Persistent infection with a high-risk human papillomavirus ({hrHPV}) is generally accepted as a necessary cause of cervical cancer. However, cervical cancer is a rare complication of an {hrHPV} infection since most such infections are transient, not even giving rise to cervical lesions. On average, it takes 12-15 years before a persistent {hrHPV} infection may ultimately, via consecutive premalignant stages (ie {CIN} lesions), lead to an overt cervical carcinoma. This argues that {HPV}-induced cervical carcinogenesis is multi-step in nature. In this review, the data from {hrHPV}-mediated in vitro transformation studies and those obtained from analysis of clinical specimens have been merged into a cervical cancer progression model. According to this model, a crucial decision maker in the early stages following infection involves individual susceptibility for certain {HPV} types depending on the genetic make-up of immune surveillance determinants. Once a {CIN} lesion has developed, altered transcriptional regulation of the viral E6/E7 oncogenes, resulting in genomic instability and distinguishing the process of cell transformation from a productive viral infection, probably provides the subsequent important step towards malignancy. The additional (epi)genetic alterations that subsequently accumulate in high-grade {CIN} lesions may result in overt malignancy via immortality and growth conditions that gradually become less sensitive to growth-modulating influences mediated by cytokines and cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesions. The potential implications of {hrHPV} testing and some other biomarkers deduced from this model for cervical screening and the clinical management of {CIN} disease are also discussed.

	abstract = {The general theory of scheduling examinations for the diagnosis of disease is formulated with respect to the optimal spacing between examinations. This same theory is also applicable, with a change in language, to the inspection of equipment and the scheduling of patients under surveillance with disease. Optimal scheduling programmes are investigated using a weighted utility function which is linear in the probabilities both of finding a case at examination and of being clinically incident between examinations. If disease incidence is independent of time, then a necessary and sufficient condition for the intervals to be equally spaced is that the sensitivity of the examination be unity. The equations for finding the optimal intervals are derived and depend on the distribution of the pre-clinical sojourn times and the sensitivity of the test. If the sojourn distribution is exponential, the optimal intervals are equal except for the first and last intervals.},

	abstract = {Background Human papillomaviruses ({HPVs}) cause genital warts and cancers in men. The natural history of {HPV} infection in men is largely unknown, and that information is needed to inform prevention strategies. The goal in this study was to estimate incidence and clearance of type-specific genital {HPV} infection in men, and to assess the associated factors. Methods Men (aged 18-70 years), residing in Brazil, Mexico, and the {USA}, who were {HIV} negative and reported no history of cancer were recruited from the general population, universities, and organised health-care systems. They were assessed every 6 months for a median follow-up of 27.5 months (18.0-31.2). Specimens from the coronal sulcus, glans penis, shaft, and scrotum were obtained for the assessment of the status of {HPV} genotypes. Findings In 1159 men, the incidence of a new genital {HPV} infection was 38.4 per 1000 person months (95\% {CI} 34.3-43-0). Oncogenic {HPV} infection was significantly associated with having a high number of lifetime female sexual partners (hazard ratio 2-40, 1-38-4-18, for at least 50 partners vs not more than one partner), and number of male anal-sexual partners (2.57, 1.46-4.49, for at least three male partners vs no recent partners). Median duration of {HPV} infection was 7-52 months (6.80-8.61) for any {HPV} and 12.19 months (7.16-18.17) for {HPV} 16. Clearance of oncogenic {HPV} infection decreased in men with a high number of lifetime female partners (0.49, 0.31-0.76, for at least 50 female partners vs not more than one partner), and in men in Brazil (0.71, 0.56-0.91) and Mexico (0.73, 0.57-0.94) compared with the {USA}. Clearance of oncogenic {HPV} was more rapid with increasing age (1.02, 1.01-1.03).

	abstract = {Objective: To assess the importance of considering decision uncertainty, the appropriateness of probabilistic sensitivity analysis ({PSA}), and the use of patient-level simulation ({PLS}) in appraisals for the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence ({NICE}). Methods: Decision-makers require estimates of decision uncertainty alongside expected net benefits ({NB}) of interventions. This requirement may be difficult in computationally expensive models, for example, those employing {PLS}. {NICE} appraisals published up until January 2005 were reviewed to identify those where the assessment group utilized a {PLS} model structure to estimate {NB}. After identifying {PLS} models, all appraisals published in the same year were reviewed. Results: Among models using {PLS}, one out of six conducted {PSA}, compared with 16 out of 24 cohort models. Justification for omitting {PSA} was absent in most cases. Reasons for choosing {PLS} included treatment switching, sampling patient characteristics and dependence on patient history. Alternative modeling approaches exist to handle these, including semi-Markov models and emulators that eliminate the need for two-level simulation. Stochastic treatment switching and sampling baseline characteristics do not inform adoption decisions. Modeling patient history does not necessitate {PLS}, and can depend on the software used. {PLS} addresses nonlinear relationships between patient variability and model outputs, but other options exist. Increased computing power, emulators or closed-form approximations can facilitate {PSA} in computationally expensive models. Conclusions: In developing models analysts should consider the dual requirement of estimating expected {NB} and characterizing decision uncertainty. It is possible to develop models that meet these requirements within the constraints set by decision-makers.},

Furthermore, clinical trials examining the efficacy of a nonavalent vaccine are underway. We aimed to compare the potential population-level effectiveness of the bivalent, quadrivalent, and candidate nonavalent {HPV} vaccines. Methods We developed an individual-based, transmission-dynamic model of {HPV} infection and disease in a population stratified by age, gender, sexual activity, and screening behavior. The model was calibrated to highly stratified sexual behavior, {HPV} epidemiology, and cervical screening data from Canada. Results Under base case assumptions, vaccinating 12-year-old girls (70\% coverage) with the bivalent (quadrivalent) vaccine is predicted to reduce the cumulative incidence of anogenital warts ({AGWs}) by 0.0\% (72.1\%), diagnosed cervical intraepithelial neoplasia lesions 2 and 3 ({CIN}2 and -3) by 51.0\% (46.1\%), and cervical squamous cell carcinoma ({SCC}) by 31.9\% (30.5\%), over 70 years. Changing from a bivalent (quadrivalent) to a nonavalent vaccine is predicted to reduce the cumulative number of {AGW} episodes by an additional 66.7\% (0.0\%), {CIN}2 and -3 episodes by an additional 9.3\% (12.5\%), and {SCC} cases by an additional 4.8\% (6.6\%) over 70 years. Differences in predicted population-level effectiveness between the vaccines were most sensitive to duration of protection and the time horizon of analysis. The vaccines produced similar effectiveness at preventing noncervical {HPV}-related cancers. Conclusions The bivalent vaccine is expected to be slightly more effective at preventing {CIN}2 and -3 and {SCC} in the longer term, whereas the quadrivalent vaccine is expected to substantially reduce {AGW} cases shortly after the start of vaccination programs. Switching to a nonavalent vaccine has the potential to further reduce precancerous lesions and cervical cancer.},

However, there is still no consensus on why and how to perform the correction. The objective was to provide theoretical foundations for {HCC} and to compare (both mathematically and numerically) the performance of different correction methods in reducing errors in outcomes from {DTSTMs}. Methods. We defined 7 methods from the field of numerical integration: Riemann sum of rectangles (left, midpoint, right), trapezoids, life-table, and Simpson's 1/3rd and 3/8th rules. We applied these methods to a standard 3-state disease progression Markov chain to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a hypothetical intervention. We solved the discrete- and continuous-time (our gold standard) versions of the model analytically and derived expressions for various outcomes including discounted quality-adjusted life-years, discounted costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. Results. The standard {HCC} method gave the same results as the trapezoidal rule and life-table method. We found situations where applying the standard {HCC} can do more harm than good. Compared with the gold standard, all correction methods resulted in approximation errors. Contrary to conventional wisdom, the errors need not cancel each other out or become insignificant when incremental outcomes are calculated. We found that a wrong decision can be made with a less accurate method. The performance of each correction method vastly improved when a shorter cycle length was selected; Simpson's 1/3rd rule was the fastest method to converge to the gold standard. Conclusion. Cumulative outcomes in {DTSTMs} are prone to errors that can be reduced with more accurate methods like Simpson's rules. We clarified several misconceptions and provided recommendations and algorithms for practical implementation of these methods.},

A method of analysis comprising stochastic simulation of the model and logistic regression of the simulated dichotomous decision variable against all of the input variables yields a direct measure of the importance of input variables to the decision. This method is demonstrated on a previously analyzed clinical decision either to continue observation or to immediately treat with anticoagulants a woman presenting with deep vein thrombosis in the first trimester of pregnancy. A relative measure of the importance of each input variable in causing a change of decision is estimated by calculating the change in the log odds attributable to variation of each input variable over its range of uncertain values compared with the total change of log odds from variation of all input variables. This method is compared with alternative measures of input variable importance, and is found to be a simple yet powerful tool for gaining quantitative insight into the nuances of a decision model.

	abstract = {Background. Microsimulation models are important decision support tools for screening. However, their complexity makes them difficult to understand and limits realization of their full potential. Therefore, it is important to develop documentation that clarifies their structure and assumptions. The authors demonstrate this problem and explore a solution for natural history using 3 independently developed colorectal cancer screening models. Methods. The authors first project effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of colonoscopy screening for the 3 models ({CRC}-{SPIN}, {SimCRC}, and {MISCAN}). Next, they provide a conventional presentation of each model, including information on structure and parameter values. Finally, they report the simulated reduction in clinical cancer incidence following a one-time complete removal of adenomas and preclinical cancers for each model. They call this new measure the maximum clinical incidence reduction ({MCLIR}). Results. Projected effectiveness varies widely across models. For example, estimated mortality reduction for colonoscopy screening every 10 years from age 50 to 80 years, with surveillance in adenoma patients, ranges from 65\% to 92\%. Given only conventional information, it is difficult to explain these differences, largely because differences in structure make parameter values incomparable. In contrast, the {MCLIR} clearly shows the impact of model differences on the key feature of natural history, the dwell time of preclinical disease. Dwell times vary from 8 to 25 years across models and help explain differences in projected screening effectiveness. Conclusions. The authors propose a new measure, the {MCLIR}, which summarizes the implications for predicted screening effectiveness of differences in natural history assumptions. Including the {MCLIR} in the standard description of a screening model would improve the transparency of these models.},

The purpose of this article is to illustrate how the methods of iterative Bayesian economic evaluation proposed in the literature can be incorporated into the development process of new medical devices, adapting them to face the relative scarcity of data and time that characterizes the process. Methods. A 3-stage economic evaluation was applied: an early phase in which simple methods allow for a quick prioritization of competing products; a mid-stage in which developers synthesize the data into a decision model, identify the parameters for which more information is most valuable, and explore uncertainty; and a late stage, in which all relevant information is synthesized. A retrospective analysis was conducted of the case study of absorbable pins, compared with metallic fixation, in osteotomy to treat hallux valgus. Results. The results from the early analysis suggest absorbable pins to be cost-effective under the beliefs and assumptions applied. The outputs from the models at the mid-stage analyses show the device to be cost-effective with a high probability. Late-stage analysis synthesizes evidence from a randomized controlled trial and informative priors, which are based on previous evidence. It also suggests that absorbable pins are the most cost-effective strategy, although the uncertainty in the model output increased considerably. Conclusions. This example illustrates how the method proposed allows decisions in the product development cycle to be based on the best knowledge that is available at each stage.},

	abstract = {We consider a specific situation of correlated data where multiple outcomes are repeatedly measured on each member of a couple. Such multivariate longitudinal data from couples may exhibit multi-faceted correlations that can be further complicated if there are polygamous partnerships. An example is data from cohort studies on human papillomavirus ({HPV}) transmission dynamics in heterosexual couples. {HPV} is a common sexually transmitted disease with 14 known oncogenic types causing anogenital cancers. The binary outcomes on the multiple types measured in couples over time may introduce inter-type, intra-couple, and temporal correlations. Simple analysis using generalized estimating equations or random effects models lacks interpretability and cannot fully use the available information. We developed a hybrid modeling strategy using Markov transition models together with pairwise composite likelihood for analyzing such data. The method can be used to identify risk factors associated with {HPV} transmission and persistence, estimate difference in risks between male-to-female and female-to-male {HPV} transmission, compare type-specific transmission risks within couples, and characterize the inter-type and intra-couple associations. Applying the method to {HPV} couple data collected in a Ugandan male circumcision ({MC}) trial, we assessed the effect of {MC} and the role of gender on risks of {HPV} transmission and persistence.

	abstract = {In signal processing, Total variation denoising, also known as total variation regularization is a process, most often used in digital image processing, that has applications in noise removal. It is based on the principle that signals with excessive and possibly spurious detail have high total variation, that is, the integral of the absolute gradient of the signal is high. According to this principle, reducing the total variation of the signal subject to it being a close match to the original signal, removes unwanted detail whilst preserving important details such as edges. The concept was pioneered by Rudin et al. in 1992 and is today known as the {ROF} model.
This noise removal technique has advantages over simple techniques such as linear smoothing or median filtering which reduce noise but at the same time smooth away edges to a greater or lesser degree. By contrast, total variation denoising is remarkably effective at simultaneously preserving edges whilst smoothing away noise in flat regions, even at low signal-to-noise ratios.},

	abstract = {Human papillomavirus ({HPV}) is the main etiologic agent of anogenital cancers, including cervical cancer, but little is known about the type-specific prevalence of {HPV} in men. Participants were men aged 18-70 years attending a sexually transmitted disease clinic. Penile skin swabs were assessed for {HPV} {DNA} using polymerase chain reaction with reverse line-blot genotyping. Of 436 swabs collected, 90.1\% yielded sufficient {DNA} for {HPV} analysis. Men with inadequate swab samples were significantly more likely to be white and circumcised than men with adequate swab samples. The prevalence of {HPV} was 28.2\%. Oncogenic {HPV} types were found in 12.0\% of participants, nononcogenic types were found in 14.8\% of participants, multiple types were found in 6.1\% of participants, and unknown types were found in 5.9\% of participants. The most prevalent subtypes were nononcogenic 6, 53, and 84. {HPV} positivity was not associated with age. These results indicate that {HPV} infection among men at high risk is common but that characteristics of male {HPV} infection may differ from those of female infection.},

	abstract = {Background: Public health interventions are increasingly being evaluated for their cost-effectiveness. Such interventions act ‘upstream’ on the determinants of ill health and commonly reduce the incidence of several diseases. Diseases that share determinants are usually correlated at an individual level, which we observe as comorbidity. This paper is motivated by the problem of estimating comorbid disease state risks when only single disease risk estimates are available. Methods: A case study is presented based on a physical activity cost-effectiveness model. The correlation between the risk of coronary heart disease, stroke and diabetes is estimated from cross sectional data using a Bayesian multivariate probit model. This is then combined with disease specific marginal baseline risks and intervention effects to give comorbid disease state risks. The expected numbers of {QALYs} gained through avoiding the comorbid states is estimated from disease specific utility data under a range of assumptions. Finally, the incremental benefit of physical activity is calculated under these utility assumptions. The difference in incremental benefit due to the intervention’s impact on reducing or increasing the disease risk correlations is explored in a sensitivity analysis. Results: If comorbidity is not taken into account, incremental benefit is overestimated compared with all scenarios in which the comorbidity is included in the model. Overestimation is greatest when physical activity is assumed to reduce disease state co-occurrence as well as disease risk. Conclusions: The proposed method reduces overestimation of benefit and allows the sensitivity to different assumptions about the correlation between disease risks to be determined.},

Toward this end, an ongoing statewide surveillance program was established in New Mexico to assess all aspects of cervical cancer preventive care. Given that the reduction in cervical cancer incidence is expected to take several decades to manifest, a systematic population-based measurement of {HPV} type-specific prevalence employing an age- and cytology-stratified sample of 47,617 women attending for cervical screening was conducted prior to widespread {HPV} vaccination. A well-validated polymerase chain reaction ({PCR}) method for 37 {HPV} genotypes was used to test liquid-based cytology specimens. The prevalence for any of the 37 {HPV} types was 27.3\% overall with a maximum of 52\% at age of 20 years followed by a rapid decline at older ages. The {HPV} 16 prevalences in women aged {\textless}= 20 years, 21-29 years or {\textgreater}= 30 years were 9.6, 6.5 and 1.8\%, respectively. The combined prevalences of {HPV} 16 and 18 in these age groups were 12.0, 8.3 and 2.4\%, respectively. {HPV} 16 and/or {HPV} 18 were detected in 54.5\% of high-grade squamous intraepithelial (cytologic) lesions ({HSIL}) and in 25.0\% of those with low-grade {SIL} ({LSIL}). These baseline data enable estimates of maximum {HPV} vaccine impact across time and provide critical reference measurements important to assessing clinical benefits and potential harms of {HPV} vaccination including increases in nonvaccine {HPV} types (i.e., type replacement).},

	abstract = {Context: Although prostate cancer ({PCa}) screening reduces the incidence of advanced disease and mortality, trade-offs include overdiagnosis and resultant overtreatment. Objective: To review primary data on {PCa} overdiagnosis and overtreatment. Evidence acquisition: Electronic searches were conducted in Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, {PubMed}, and Embase from inception to July 2013 for original articles on {PCa} overdiagnosis and overtreatment. Supplemental articles were identified through hand searches. Evidence synthesis: The lead-time and excess-incidence approaches are the main ways used to estimate overdiagnosis in epidemiological studies, with estimates varying widely. The estimated number of {PCa} cases needed to be diagnosed to save a life has ranged from 48 down to 5 with increasing follow-up. In clinical studies, generally lower rates of overdiagnosis have been reported based on the frequency of low-grade minimal tumors at radical prostatectomy (1.7-46.8\%). Autopsy studies have reported {PCa} in 18.5-38.5\%, although not all are low grade or low volume. Factors influencing overdiagnosis include the study population, screening protocol, and background incidence, limiting generalizability between settings. Reported rates of overtreatment vary widely in the literature, although contemporary international studies suggest increasing use of conservative management. Conclusions: Epidemiological, clinical, and autopsy studies have been used to examine {PCa} overdiagnosis, with estimates ranging widely from 1.7\% to 67\%. Correspondingly, estimates of overtreatment vary widely based on patient features and may be declining internationally. Careful patient selection for screening and reducing overtreatment are important to preserve the benefits and reduce the downstream harms of prostatespecific antigen testing. Because all of these estimates are extremely population and context specific, this must be considered when using these data to inform policy. Patient summary: Screening reduces spread and death from prostate cancer ({PCa}) but overdiagnoses some low-risk tumors that may not have caused harm. Because treatment has potential side effects, it is critical that not all patients with {PCa} receive aggressive treatment. Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of European Association of Urology.},

Modelling and economic studies have addressed some of those information needs. We conducted a qualitative systematic review to summarize the existing data. Review articles were obtained from an extensive literature search on studies using mathematical modelling (either a Markov or transmission dynamic model) to determine the effectiveness or cost effectiveness of an {HPV} vaccine compared with the current cytology-based Pap smear screening programme. A total of 21 studies (but 22 models) were included in the review after being assessed for methodological quality. All of the included studies had used a mathematical model to determine the effectiveness of an {HPV} vaccine, whilst 13 had also conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis. Although the studies used different model structures, baseline parameters and assumptions, all studies showed that vaccination would decrease rates of {HPV} infection, precancerous lesions and cervical cancer. Studies had a consistent message with respect to cost effectiveness: a female-only vaccination programme is cost effective compared with the current cytology-based Pap smear screening programme, while the cost effectiveness of a male and female vaccination programme is generally not cost effective compared with female-only vaccination.},

In today's ethical climate, however, it is almost impossible to observe this directly and therefore must be inferred from observations with intervention. In this paper, we illustrate a Bayesian approach to this situation when the observations are at separated and unequally spaced time points and the time of intervention is interval censored. We develop a discrete-time Markov model which combines a non-homogeneous Markov chain, used to model the natural progression, with mechanisms that describe the possibility of both treatment intervention and death. We apply this approach to a subpopulation of the Wisconsin Epidemiologic Study of Diabetic Retinopathy, a population-based cohort study to investigate prevalence, incidence, and progression of diabetic retinopathy. In addition, posterior predictive distributions are discussed as a prognostic tool to assist researchers in evaluating costs and benefits of treatment protocols. While we focus this approach on diabetic retinopathy cohort data, we believe this methodology can have wide application. (C) 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {With rapid improvements in medical treatment and health care, many datasets dealing with time to relapse or death now reveal a substantial portion of patients who are cured (i.e., who never experience the event). Extended survival models called cure rate models account for the probability of a subject being cured and can be broadly classified into the classical mixture models of Berkson and Gage ({BG} type) or the stochastic tumor models pioneered by Yakovlev and extended to a hierarchical framework by Chen, Ibrahim, and Sinha ({YCIS} type). Recent developments in Bayesian hierarchical Cure models have evoked significant interest regarding relationships and preferences between these two classes of models. Our present work proposes a unifying class of cure rate models that facilitates flexible hierarchical model-building while including both existing cure model classes as special cases. This unifying class enables robust modeling by accounting for uncertainty in underlying mechanisms leading to cure. Issues such as regressing on the cure fraction and propriety of the associated posterior distributions under different modeling assumptions are also discussed. Finally, we offer a simulation study and also illustrate with two datasets (on melanoma and breast cancer) that reveal our framework's ability to distinguish among underlying mechanisms that lead to relapse and cure.},

	abstract = {A survey of the sexual behaviour of gonorrhoea patients in Newark was undertaken to evaluate parameters within a model of gonorrhoea transmission. Modelling work aimed to explain observed epidemiological patterns and to explore the potential impact of interventions. Reported behaviours, along with values derived from the literature, were used within a standard deterministic model of gonorrhoea transmission, where the population was stratified according to sex and rates of sex-partner change. The behaviours reported, particularly among women, are insufficient by themselves to explain the continued existence of gonorrhoea within the population The majority of symptomatic patients seek treatment within a few days, and report that they do not have unprotected sex while symptomatic. The proportion of patients with low numbers of sex partners suggests that sexual mixing between people categorized according to sexual behaviour is near random. To explain the persistence of gonorrhoea, there must be some patients who, when infected, do not seek care in public clinics. In addition, gonorrhoea incidence in the model is sensitive to change, such that very small reductions in risk behaviour could lead to its elimination. This does not accord with the observed failure of many interventions to eliminate infection, suggesting that the modelled infection is too sensitive to change. The model, which has been influential in gonorrhoea epidemiology, is not consistent with the observed epidemiology of gonorrhoea in populations. Alternative models need to explore the observed stability of gonorrhoea before robust modelling conclusions can be drawn on how best to control infection. However, the current results do highlight the potential importance of asymptomatic infections and infections in those who are diseased and do not attend public health services. Screening and contact-tracing to identify asymptomatic infections in both men and women will be more effective in reaching those who maintain the infection within the community rather than simply treating symptomatic cases.},

The analysis is motivated by consideration of two diseases-coronary artery disease and chronic kidney disease-in which the choice of treatment may depend on the patient's tradeoff between these attributes. Certain plausible independence properties lead to a quasi-additive utility function for life years and health status. Particular attention is given to utility functions for life years exhibiting constant proportional risk posture. An empirical assessment shows that stated preferences appear consistent with this functional form. The derived utility functions have been applied to the treatment decision of whether to prescribe coronary artery bypass graft surgery in patients with coronary artery disease.},

Methods: Two models of {HPV} transmission and associated cervical disease (squamous and glandular, neoplasia and cancer) were fitted to data from England and Canada on {HPV} epidemiology, sexual behaviour, cervical screening outcomes and cervical cancer incidence. Results: Models suggest that at 40-80\% coverage, if two-dose schedules protect vaccinees for 20 years, then the benefits of the third dose are small. If two doses protect for 10 years, then the third dose may prevent as many cancers as the first two. At 80\% coverage, numbers needed to receive a third dose to prevent an additional cancer are 5900-110,000 (England), 3000-5100 (Canada) with 20 years two-dose protection, and 2000-5300 (England), 760-950 (Canada) with 10 years two-dose protection.

	abstract = {Background. Cervical cancer is caused by persistent infection with human papillomavirus ({HPV}). Most infections and associated lesions clear spontaneously. It is important to define the determinants and timing of clearance, so that viral persistence can be recognized and managed. Methods. We investigated {HPV} natural history among 4504 subjects from {ALTS} (Atypical Squamous Cells of Undetermined Significance/ Low- Grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesions Triage Study). A discrete- time Markov model was used to simultaneously describe the prevalence, incidence, and persistence of type- specific {HPV} infection over 24 months in women with equivocal or mildly abnormal cytological results. Interactions between multiple {HPV} types infecting the same woman were examined for incidence of new infection (after an {HPV}- 16 infection) and persistence of a current infection within groups defined by phylogenetic relatedness or by carcinogenicity. Results. Ninety-one percent (95\% credible interval [{CI}], 90\% - 92\%) of prevalent {HPV} infections at enrollment cleared within 24 months. The probability that an infection would persist for a further 6 months increased with the duration of infection, from 37\% (95\% {CI}, 35\% - 39\%) for a newly observed infection to 65\% (95\% {CI}, 61\% 70\%) for an infection that had already persisted for similar to 18 months. No consistent evidence of interactions was found between multiple {HPV} types regarding the incidence of new infection after an {HPV}- 16 infection or regarding persistence of current {HPV} infection. Conclusion. Although virtually all {HPV} infections clear within 2 years, the remaining infections have a high potential for persistence and, by implication, progression to precancer and cancer. Once biological and behavioral determinants are controlled for, {HPV} infections with different types seem to be independent of each other.},

In the absence of routine vaccination in the community, the model is shown to undergo the phenomenon of backward bifurcation. This phenomenon, which has important consequences on the feasibility of effective disease control in the community, arises due to the re-infection of recovered individuals. For the special case when backward bifurcation does not occur, the disease-free equilibrium ({DFE}) of the model is shown to be globally-asymptotically stable ({GAS}) if the associated reproduction number is less than unity. The model with vaccination is also rigorously analyzed. Numerical simulations of the model with vaccination show that, with the assumed 90\% efficacy of the Gardasil vaccine, the effective community-wide control of the four Gardasil-preventable {HPV} types is feasible if the Gardasil coverage rate is high enough (in the range 78-88\%).},

Design Data from two international, double blind, placebo controlled, randomised efficacy trials of quadrivalent {HPV} vaccine (protocol 013 ({FUTURE} I) and protocol 015 ({FUTURE} {II})). The trials were to be 4 years in length, and the results reported are from final study data of 42 months' follow-up. Setting Primary care centres and university or hospital associated health centres in 24 countries and territories around the world. Participants 17 622 women aged 16-26 years enrolled between December 2001 and May 2003. Major exclusion criteria were lifetime number of sexual partners ({\textgreater}4), history of abnormal cervical smear test results, and pregnancy. Intervention Three doses of quadrivalent {HPV} vaccine (for serotypes 6, 11, 16, and 18) or placebo at day 1, month 2, and month 6. Main outcome measures Vaccine efficacy against cervical, vulvar, and vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia grade I and condyloma in a per protocol susceptible population that included subjects who received all three vaccine doses, tested negative for the relevant vaccine {HPV} types at day 1 and remained negative through month 7, and had no major protocol violations. Intention to treat, generally {HPV} naive, and unrestricted susceptible populations were also studied. Results In the per protocol susceptible population, vaccine efficacy against lesions related to the {HPV} types in the vaccine was 96\% for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade I (95\% confidence interval 91\% to 98\%), 100\% for both vulvar and vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia grade I (95\% {CIs} 74\% to 100\%, 64\% to 100\% respectively), and 99\% for condyloma (96\% to 100\%). Vaccine efficacy against any lesion (regardless of {HPV} type) in the generally naive population was 30\% (17\% to 41\%), 75\% (22\% to 94\%), and 48\% (10\% to 71\%) for cervical, vulvar, and vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia grade I, respectively, and 83\% (74\% to 89\%) for condyloma. Conclusions Quadrivalent {HPV} vaccine provided sustained protection against low grade lesions attributable to vaccine {HPV} types (6, 11, 16, and 18) and a substantial reduction in the burden of these diseases through 42 months of follow-up.},

	abstract = {Australia implemented a National {HPV} Vaccination Program in 2007, with routine vaccination of 12-13 year old females and catch-up in females aged 13-26 years to 2009. The aim of this study was to estimate the impact of the current female-only national vaccination program on males, and then to estimate the incremental benefits to males from being included in the program. We used preliminary data to estimate vaccination coverage in females. We then fitted a dynamic model of sexual behaviour and {HPV} transmission in Australia to local data on female pre-vaccination age-specific {HPV} prevalence, predicted the corresponding pre-vaccination prevalence in males due to heterosexual transmission, and modelled the short and long term impact of female-only versus female-and-male vaccination programs. The estimated 3-dose female coverage rates were 78\% (range 70-80\%) for ongoing coverage in 12-13 year old girls; and from 74\% (range 70-80\%) in 14 year olds, to 25\% (range 15-35\%) for women aged 26 years old in 2007. The median estimate for age-standardised pre-vaccination {HPV} 16 prevalence in females and males aged 15-59 years was 3.2\% (95\% range: 2.4-4.1\%) and 3.1\% (95\% range: 2.2-4.2\%), respectively. The current program in females is predicted to result in a 68\% reduction in male {HPV} 16 infections by 2050, leading to an estimated long term reduction of 14\% in rates of cancers of the head, neck and anogenital area. The estimated proportion of the maximum possible vaccine-conferred benefit to males from a female-and-male program which will be achieved by female-only vaccination is 73\% (range in probabilistic sensitivity analysis: 53-78\%). In conclusion, up to three-quarters of the maximum possible vaccination-conferred benefit to males due to reduced heterosexual transmission will be achieved by the existing female-only program.

	abstract = {In 1992, Watts and May introduced a simple dynamical systems model of the spread of {HIV} based on disease transmission per partnership including the length of partnership duration. This model allowed for the treatment of concurrent partnerships although it was hampered by the assumption of an important latent phase which generated a non-autonomous system. Subsequent models including concurrency have been based on networks, Monte Carlo, and stochastic simulations which lose a qualitative understanding of the effects of concurrency. We present a new autonomous deterministic model of the effect of concurrent sexual partnerships that allows for an analytical study of disease transmission. We incorporate the effect of concurrency through the newly derived force of infection term in a mathematical model of the transmission of {HIV} through sexual contact in a population stratified by sexual behavior and race/ethnicity. The model also includes variations in population mixing (partner choice) and non-uniform Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Treatment ({HAART}) leading to viral suppression. We use this mathematical model to understand the non-uniform spread of {HIV} in women who were infected through heterosexual contact. In addition, an analytical study shows the importance of continued condom use in virally suppressed {MSM}. Numerical simulations of the reproduction number as a function of concurrency, viral suppression level, and mixing show a reservoir of disease present in both heterosexual and {MSM} populations. Statistical analysis of parameter values show that viral suppression level, mixing and progression to {AIDS} without viral suppression have a strong correlation (either positive or negative) with the number of {HIV} positive women. Concurrency and assortative mixing are shown to be essential to reproduce infection levels in women, as reported by 2010 data from the Center for Disease Control ({CDC}).},

	abstract = {Computational models in biomedicine rely on biological and clinical assumptions. The selection of these assumptions contributes substantially to modeling success or failure. Assumptions used by experts at the cutting edge of research, however, are rarely explicitly described in scientific publications. One can directly collect and assess some of these assumptions through interviews and surveys. Here we investigate diversity in expert views about a complex biological phenomenon, the process of cancer metastasis. We harvested individual viewpoints from 28 experts in clinical and molecular aspects of cancer metastasis and summarized them computationally. While experts predominantly agreed on the definition of individual steps involved in metastasis, no two expert scenarios for metastasis were identical. We computed the probability that any two experts would disagree on k or fewer metastatic stages and found that any two randomly selected experts are likely to disagree about several assumptions. Considering the probability that two or more of these experts review an article or a proposal about metastatic cascades, the probability that they will disagree with elements of a proposed model approaches 1. This diversity of conceptions has clear consequences for advance and deadlock in the field. We suggest that strong, incompatible views are common in biomedicine but largely invisible to biomedical experts themselves. We built a formal Markov model of metastasis to encapsulate expert convergence and divergence regarding the entire sequence of metastatic stages. This model revealed stages of greatest disagreement, including the points at which cancer enters and leaves the bloodstream. The model provides a formal probabilistic hypothesis against which researchers can evaluate data on the process of metastasis. This would enable subsequent improvement of the model through Bayesian probabilistic update. Practically, we propose that model assumptions and hunches be harvested systematically and made available for modelers and scientists.},

Methods: We used a simplified model of {HPV} transmission to estimate the reduction in the health and economic burden of {HPV}-associated diseases in males and females as a result of {HPV} vaccination. Estimates of the incidence, cost-per-case, and quality-of-life impact of {HPV}-associated health outcomes were based on the literature. The {HPV}-associated outcomes included were: cervical intraepithelial neoplasia ({CIN}); genital warts; juvenile-onset recurrent respiratory papillomatosis ({RRP}): and cervical, vaginal, vulvar, anal, oropharyngeal, and penile cancers. Results: The cost-effectiveness of male vaccination depended on vaccine coverage of females. When including all {HPV}-associated outcomes in the analysis, the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year ({QALY}) gained by adding male vaccination to a female-only vaccination program was \$23,600 in the lower female coverage scenario (20\% coverage at age 12 years) and \$184,300 in the higher female coverage scenario (75\% coverage at age 12 years). The cost-effectiveness of male vaccination appeared less favorable when compared to a strategy of increased female vaccination coverage. For example, we found that increasing coverage of 12-year-old girls would be more cost-effective than adding male vaccination even if the increased female vaccination strategy incurred program costs of \$350 per additional girl vaccinated. Conclusions: {HPV} vaccination of 12-year-old males might potentially be cost-effective, particularly if female {HPV} vaccination coverage is low and if all potential health benefits of {HPV} vaccination are included in the analysis. However, increasing female coverage could be a more efficient strategy than male vaccination for reducing the overall health burden of {HPV} in the population. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Human papillomavirus ({HPV}) vaccines provide an opportunity to reduce the incidence of cervical cancer. Optimization of cervical cancer prevention programs requires anticipation of the degree to which the public will adhere to vaccination recommendations. To compare vaccination levels driven by public perceptions with levels that are optimal for maximizing the community's overall utility, we develop an epidemiological game-theoretic model of {HPV} vaccination. The model is parameterized with survey data on actual perceptions regarding cervical cancer, genital warts, and {HPV} vaccination collected from parents of vaccine-eligible children in the United States. The results suggest that perceptions of survey respondents generate vaccination levels far lower than those that maximize overall health-related utility for the population. Vaccination goals may be achieved by addressing concerns about vaccine risk, particularly those related to sexual activity among adolescent vaccine recipients. In addition, cost subsidizations and shifts in federal coverage plans may compensate for perceived and real costs of {HPV} vaccination to achieve public health vaccination targets.},

	abstract = {Background Several trials evaluating the effect of prostate-specific antigen ({PSA}) testing on prostate-cancer mortality have shown conflicting results. We updated prostate-cancer mortality in the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer with 2 additional years of follow-up. Methods The study involved 182,160 men between the ages of 50 and 74 years at entry, with a predefined core age group of 162,388 men 55 to 69 years of age. The trial was conducted in eight European countries. Men who were randomly assigned to the screening group were offered {PSA}-based screening, whereas those in the control group were not offered such screening. The primary outcome was mortality from prostate cancer. Results After a median follow-up of 11 years in the core age group, the relative reduction in the risk of death from prostate cancer in the screening group was 21\% (rate ratio, 0.79; 95\% confidence interval [{CI}], 0.68 to 0.91; P = 0.001), and 29\% after adjustment for noncompliance. The absolute reduction in mortality in the screening group was 0.10 deaths per 1000 person-years or 1.07 deaths per 1000 men who underwent randomization. The rate ratio for death from prostate cancer during follow-up years 10 and 11 was 0.62 (95\% {CI}, 0.45 to 0.85; P = 0.003). To prevent one death from prostate cancer at 11 years of follow-up, 1055 men would need to be invited for screening and 37 cancers would need to be detected. There was no significant between-group difference in all-cause mortality. Conclusions Analyses after 2 additional years of follow-up consolidated our previous finding that {PSA}-based screening significantly reduced mortality from prostate cancer but did not affect all-cause mortality.

Analyses were performed in the {UK} because of the large amount of high quality epidemiological data available. For each {HPV} type/group of types considered, the model was calibrated to 14 epidemiological datasets (prevalence of {HPV} infection, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia ({CIN}): {CIN}1, {CIN}2, {CIN}3 pre-screening and cervical cancer ({CC}) incidence over 10 y post-screening). Impacts of cross-protection, female catch-up vaccination, and additional male vaccination on oncogenic infections, high-grade {CIN} ({CIN}2+) and {CC} were evaluated. Our results show that female {UMV} with 80\% coverage and cross-protection against high-risk types resulted in 81\% {CIN}2+ and 88\% {CC} reductions vs. 57\% and 75\%, respectively, without cross-protection. Vaccinating 40\% of males and 80\% of females was equivalent to 90\% female-only coverage regarding {CIN}2+ (87\% and 87\%, respectively) and {CC} (93\% and 94\%, respectively) reductions. Female-only coverage of 80\% substantially reduced male {HPV}16 and 18 infection due to herd protection (74\% and 89\%, respectively). Increasing female coverage to 90\% reduced {HPV}16 and {HPV}18 infections in males relatively similarly to 80\% female combined with 40\% male coverage. Model outcomes strengthen previous conclusions about the significant added value of Cervarix ({TM}) crossprotection for {CC} prevention, the primary {HPV} vaccination public health priority. Regarding female {CC} prevention and male {HPV}16/18 infection, small increases in female coverage induce similar benefits to those achieved by additionally vaccinating men with 40\% coverage.},

{MethodsAn} individual-based mathematical model of chlamydia transmission was developed and linked to the infection course in chlamydia-infected individuals. The model describes the impact of a vaccine through its effect on the chlamydial load required to infect susceptible individuals (the “critical load”), the load in infected individuals, and their subsequent infectiousness. The model was calibrated using behavioral, biological, and clinical data
{ResultsA} fully protective chlamydia vaccine administered before sexual debut can theoretically eliminate chlamydia epidemics within 20 years. Partially effective vaccines can still greatly reduce the incidence of chlamydia infection. Vaccines should aim primarily to increase the critical load in susceptible individuals and secondarily to decrease the peak load and/or the duration of infection in vaccinated individuals who become infected. Vaccinating both sexes has a beneficial impact on chlamydia-related morbidity, but targeting women is more effective than targeting men
{ConclusionsOur} findings can be used in laboratory settings to evaluate vaccine candidates in animal models, by regulatory bodies in the promotion of candidates for clinical trials, and by public health authorities in deciding on optimal intervention strategies},

We review synthesis issues that arise on the construction of the baseline natural history model. We cover both the absolute response to treatment on the outcome measures on which comparative effectiveness is defined and the other elements of the natural history model, usually downstream of the shorter-term effects reported in trials. We recommend that the same framework be used to model the absolute effects of a standard treatment or placebo comparator as that used for synthesis of relative treatment effects and that the baseline model is constructed independently from the model for relative treatment effects, to ensure that the latter are not affected by assumptions made about the baseline. However, simultaneous modeling of baseline and treatment effects could have some advantages when evidence is very sparse or when other research or study designs give strong reasons for believing in a particular baseline model. The predictive distribution, rather than the fixed effect or random effects mean, should be used to represent the baseline to reflect the observed variation in baseline rates. Joint modeling of multiple baseline outcomes based on data from trials or combinations of trial and observational data is recommended where possible, as this is likely to make better use of available evidence, produce more robust results, and ensure that the model is internally coherent.},

	abstract = {Objectives Despite early treatment of urethral infection, gonorrhoea is endemic in urban populations of men who have sex with men ({MSM}) in Australia. By contrast, gonorrhoea is not common in urban heterosexual populations. Sexual activities among {MSM} usually involve anal or oral sex, and as these behaviours are becoming increasingly common among heterosexuals, there is a need to investigate their roles in transmission of gonorrhoea. Methods We developed individual-based models of transmission of gonorrhoea in {MSM} and heterosexuals that incorporate anatomical site-specific transmission of gonorrhoea. We estimated the probabilities of transmission for anal sex and oral sex by calibrating an {MSM} model against prevalence of gonorrhoea and sexual activity data. These probabilities were then applied to a heterosexual model in order to examine whether gonorrhoea can persist in a heterosexual population through the addition of anal sex and oral sex. Results In the {MSM} model, gonorrhoea can persist despite prompt treatment of urethral infections. The probability of gonorrhoea persisting is reduced if use of condom for oral sex is increased to more than 15\% of acts. Assuming that treatment of symptomatic infections is prompt, gonorrhoea is unlikely to persist in a heterosexual population even with the addition of anal and oral sex. Conclusions Our models suggest that oral sex has an important role in sustaining gonorrhoea in a population of {MSM} by providing a pool of untreated asymptomatic infection. The importance of anal sex or oral sex in sustaining gonorrhoea in a heterosexual population remains uncertain due to the lack of information linking different types of sex acts and transmissibility.},

{DESIGN}: A mathematical model was developed to simulate the population-level impact of different {HIV} interventions in {SA}. Probability distributions were specified to represent uncertainty around 32 epidemiological parameters that could be influenced by interventions, and correlation coefficients (r) were calculated to assess the sensitivity of the adult {HIV} incidence rates and mother-to-child transmission rates (2015-2035) to each epidemiological parameter.
{RESULTS}: {HIV} incidence in {SA} adults (ages 15-49) is expected to decline from 1.4\% in 2011-2012 to 0.29\% by 2035 (95\% {CI}: 0.10-0.62\%). The parameters most strongly correlated with future adult {HIV} incidence are the rate of viral suppression after initiating antiretroviral treatment ({ART}) (r=-0.56), the level of condom use in non-marital relationships (r=-0.40), the phase-in of intensified risk-reduction counselling for {HIV}-positive adults (r=0.29), the uptake of medical male circumcision (r=-0.24) and the phase-in of universal {ART} eligibility (r=0.22). The paediatric {HIV} parameters most strongly associated with mother-to-child transmission rates are the relative risk of transmission through breastfeeding when the mother is receiving {ART} (r=0.70) and the rate of {ART} initiation during pregnancy (r=-0.16).
{CONCLUSIONS}: The virtual elimination target of a 0.1\% incidence rate in adults will be difficult to achieve. Interventions that address the infectiousness of patients after {ART} initiation will be particularly critical to achieving long-term {HIV} incidence declines in South Africa.},

	abstract = {Background: Human papillomavirus ({HPV}) is the main cause of cervical neoplasia, Because few population-based studies have investigated the prevalence of type-specific infection in relation to cervical disease, we studied a high-risk population, estimating the prevalence of {HPV} infection and the risk associated with various {HPV} types. Methods: We screened 9175 women in Guanacaste, Costa Rica, to obtain a referent standard final diagnosis, and tested 3024 women for more than 40 types of {HPV} with a polymerase chain reaction-based system. Results: Among women with normal cytology, {HPV} infections peaked first in women younger than 25 gears, and they peaked again at age 55 years or older with predominantly non-cancer-associated types of {HPV} and uncharacterized {HPV} types. Low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions ({LSILs}) (n = 189) decreased consistently with age. The prevalence of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions ({HSILs}) (n = 128) peaked first around age 30 years and again at age 65 years or older. Seventy-three percent of {LSILs} were {HPV} positive, with {HPV}16 being the predominant type (16\% of positive subjects). {HPV} was found in 89\% of {HSILs} and 88\% of cancers, with {HPV}16 being strongly predominant (51\% and 53\% of positive subjects). Virtually all {HSILs} and cancers had cancer-associated {HPV} types, with high odds ratios ({ORs}) and attributable fractions around 80\%, Risk for {HPV}16 was particularly high ({OR} for {HSILs} = 320, 95\% confidence interval [{CI}] = 97-1000; {OR} for cancer = 710, 95\% {CI} = 110-4500), Conclusions: We confirm the early decline of {HPV} infection with age but note increased prevalence after menopause, which could be related to a second peak of {HSILs}, an observation that warrants further investigation, At least 80\% of {HPVs} involved in cervical carcinogenesis in this population have been characterized. Polyvalent vaccines including the main cancer-associated {HPV} types may be able to prevent most cases of cervical disease in this region.},

	abstract = {The standard approach to early detection of disease with a quantitative marker is to set a population-based fixed reference level for making further individual screening or referral decisions. For many types of disease, including prostate and ovarian cancer, additional information is contained in the subject-specific temporal behavior of the marker, which exhibits a characteristic alteration early in the course of the disease. In this article we derive a Bayesian approach to screening based on calculation of the posterior probability of disease given longitudinal marker levels. The method is motivated by a randomized ovarian cancer screening trial in the United Kingdom comprising 22,000 women screened over 4 years with an additional 5 years of follow-up on average. Levels of the antigen {CA}125 were recorded annually in the screened arm. {CA}125 profiles of cases and controls from the U.K. trial are modeled using hierarchical changepoint and mixture models, posterior distributions are calculated using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, and the model is used to calculate the Bayesian posterior risk of having ovarian cancer given a new subject's single or multiple longitudinal {CA}125 levels. A screening strategy based on the risk calculation is then evaluated using data from an independent screening trial of 5,550 women performed in Sweden. A longitudinal {CA}125 screening strategy based on calculation of the risk of ovarian cancer is proposed. Simulations of a prospective trial using a strategy based on the risk calculated from longitudinal {CA}125 values indicate potentially large increases in sensitivity for a given specificity compared to the standard approach based on a fixed {CA}125 reference level for all subjects.},

	abstract = {Background: Overdiagnosis of clinically insignificant prostate cancer is considered a major potential drawback of prostate-specific antigen ({PSA}) screening. Quantitative estimates of the magnitude of this problem are, however, lacking. We estimated rates of prostate cancer overdiagnosis due to {PSA} testing that are consistent with the observed incidence of prostate cancer in the United States from 1988 through 1998. Overdiagnosis was defined as the detection of prostate cancer through {PSA} testing that otherwise would not have been diagnosed within the patient's lifetime. Methods: We developed a computer simulation model of {PSA} testing and subsequent prostate cancer diagnosis and death from prostate cancer among a hypothetical cohort of two million men who were 60-84 years old in 1988. Given values for the expected lead time-that is, the time by which the test advanced diagnosis-and the expected incidence of prostate cancer in the absence of {PSA} testing, the model projected the increase in population incidence of prostate cancer associated with {PSA} testing. By comparing the model-projected incidence with the observed incidence derived from the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results ({SEER}) registry data, we determined the lead times and corresponding overdiagnosis rates that were consistent with the observed data. Results: {SEER} data on prostate cancer incidence from 1988 through 1998 were consistent with overdiagnosis rates of approximately 29\% for whites and 44\% for blacks among men with prostate cancers detected by {PSA} screening. Conclusions: Among men with prostate cancer that would be detected only at autopsy, these rates correspond to overdiagnosis rates of, at most, 15\% in whites and 37\% in blacks. The observed trends in prostate cancer incidence are consistent with considerable overdiagnosis among {PSA}-detected cases. However, the results suggest that the majority of screen-detected cancers diagnosed between 1988 and 1998 would have presented clinically and that only a minority of cases found at autopsy would have been detected by {PSA} testing.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we review the published evidence about the long-term efficacy of the available human papillomavirus ({HPV}) vaccines and their safety profile. Two prophylactic {HPV} vaccines - bivalent ({bHPV}) and quadrivalent ({qHPV}) - are now available, and vaccination programs are being widely implemented, primarily targeting adolescent girls. Efficacy has been widely demonstrated for both vaccines. Since the risk of {HPV} exposure potentially persists throughout a woman's sexual life, vaccine duration of protection is critical to overall effectiveness. Interpreting the results of long-term efficacy studies for the two {HPV} vaccines can be puzzling, due to the heterogeneity of studies, different methods used in the assessment of immunogenicity, histopathological and virological end points, and statistical power issues. Moreover, an immunologic correlate of protection has not yet been established, and it is unknown whether higher antibody levels will really result in a longer duration of protection. Disease prevention remains the most important measure of long-term duration of vaccine efficacy. To date, the longest follow-up of an {HPV} vaccine has been 9.4 years for the {bHPV} vaccine. Long-term follow-up for {qHPV} vaccine goes up to 8 years. The vaccine continues to be immunogenic and well tolerated up to 9 years following vaccination. All randomized controlled clinical trials of the {bHPV} and the {qHPV} vaccines provide evidence of an excellent safety profile. The most common complaint reported is pain in the injection site, which is self-limiting and spontaneously resolved. The incidence of systemic adverse events ({AEs}), serious {AEs}, and discontinuations due to a serious {AE} reported in clinical studies are similar between the two vaccines and their control groups. In particular, no increased risk of autoimmune disease has been shown among {HPV}-vaccinated subjects in long-term observation studies. As these are crucial topics in {HPV} vaccination, it is important to establish systems for continued monitoring of vaccine immunogenicity, efficacy, and safety over time.},

Previously we demonstrated that a specific viral genotype was not identified in 14\% of all genital specimens (i.e., {HPV} unclassified specimens) using the Roche Linear Array method. Our goal was to identify and assess the prevalence of individual {HPV} types among genital {HPV} unclassified specimens collected in the {HIM} Study population, at enrollment, and examine associations with socio-demographic and behavioral characteristics.
{METHODS}: Genital skin specimens of men that were considered unclassified ({HPV} {PCR} positive, no genotype specified) at enrollment were typed by sequencing amplified {PGMY}09/11 products or cloning of {PGMY}/{GP}+ nested amplicons followed by sequencing. {PGMY}/{GP}+ negative specimens were further analyzed using {FAP} primers. {HPV} type classification was conducted through comparisons with sequences in the {GenBank} database.
{RESULTS}: Readable nucleotide sequences were generated for the majority of previously unclassified specimens (66\%), including both characterized (77\%) and yet uncharacterized (23\%) {HPV} types. Of the characterized {HPV} types, most (73\%) were Beta [β]-{HPVs}, primarily from β-1 and β-2 species, followed by Alpha [α]-{HPVs} (20\%). Smokers (current and former) were significantly more likely to have an α-{HPV} infection, compared with any other genus; no other factors were associated with specific {HPV} genera or specific β-{HPV} species.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Male genital skin harbor a large number of β-{HPV} types. Knowledge concerning the prevalence of the diverse {HPV} types in the men genital is important to better understand the transmission of these viruses.},

The approach proceeds by simulating the tree, backward in time from observed data, to a most recent common ancestor. However, in many cases, the computational time and variance of estimators are often too high to make standard approaches useful.

All kinds of assumptions on the natural history of colorectal cancer and screening and surveillance strategies can easily be incorporated in the model. {MISCAN}-{COLON} gives detailed output of incidence, prevalence and mortality, and the results and effects of screening.

	abstract = {{SummaryBackground}
{HIV}-1 prevalence typically rises more rapidly at young ages in women than in men in sub-Saharan Africa. Greater susceptibility to infection on exposure in women is believed to be a contributory factor as is greater exposure to previously infected sexual partners of the opposite sex. We investigated the latter hypothesis using data from a field study in rural Manicaland, Zimbabwe.
Methods
Quantitative data on onset and degree of sexual activity, numbers of partners, concurrent partnerships, condom use, and partner characteristics were used in conjunction with epidemiological data on age and sex specific prevalence of {HIV} infection to do statistical analyses of association between key variables. Mathematical models and qualitative data were used to aid analysis and interpretation.
Findings
Older age of sexual partner was associated with increased risk of {HIV}-1 infection in men (odds ratio 1·13 [95\% {CI} 1·02–1·25]) and women (1·04 [1·01–1·07]). Young women form partnerships with men 5–10 years older than themselves, whereas young men have relationships with women of a similar age or slightly younger. Greater number of lifetime partners is also associated with increased risk of {HIV} (1·03 [1·00–1·05]). Young men report more partners than do women but infrequent coital acts and greater use of condoms. These behaviour patterns are underpinned by cultural factors including the expectation that women should marry earlier than men. A strong gender effect remains after factors that affect exposure to infected partners are controlled for (6·04 [1·49–24·47]).
Interpretation
The substantial age difference between female and male sexual partners in Manicaland is the major behavioural determinant of the more rapid rise in {HIV} prevalence in young women than in men. Theoretical studies have suggested that this difference is an important determinant of observed epidemiological patterns but the study reported in this paper provides clear empirical evidence of association.},

We evaluated {HPV}-based screening in both {HPV}-unvaccinated women and cohorts offered {HPV} vaccination in New Zealand (vaccination coverage similar to 50\%). Methods A complex model of {HPV} transmission, vaccination, cervical screening, and invasive cervical cancer was extensively validated against national population-based datasets. Sixteen potential strategies for {HPV} screening were considered. Results Most primary {HPV} strategies were more effective than current practice, for both unvaccinated women and cohorts offered vaccination. The optimal strategy for both groups was 5-yearly {HPV} screening in women aged 25-69 years with partial genotyping for {HPV} 16/18 and referral to colposcopy, and cytological triage of other oncogenic types. This is predicted to reduce cervical cancer incidence and mortality by a further 12-16\% and to save 4-13\% annually in program costs (excluding overheads). The findings are sensitive to assumptions about future adherence to initiating screening at 25 years. Conclusion Primary {HPV} screening with partial genotyping would be more effective and less costly than the current cytology-based screening program, in both unvaccinated women and cohorts offered vaccination.

Specifically, we seek to answer two questions: (1) What are the major contributors to false positive test results for patients? (2) How does variability between different radiologists affect outcomes for patients? We develop a simulation-based model that combines statistical process control ({SPC}) with a partially observable Markov decision process ({POMDP}) to incorporate uncertainty, the inherent variability between radiologists, and system noise (i.e., screening characteristics such as different densities of breast tissue, inherent variability between different women, and imperfections in the mammogram and technology) to determine the impact on the breast cancer monitoring decision. When compared to population-based noise, we find that the variability among different radiologists in the ability to correctly interpret a mammogram has the most significant impact on whether a woman will receive incorrect results. Variability within the population of radiologists significantly increases in the number of false-positive mammogram results a woman receives. This suggests that reducing the variability between radiologists should be a primary concern to improve health care for women.},

	abstract = {Evidence regarding the potential benefits of a particular health care intervention is often available from a variety of disparate sources. However, formal synthesis of such evidence has traditionally concentrated almost exclusively on that derived from randomized studies, although for a range of conditions the randomized evidence will be less than adequate due to economic, organizational or ethical considerations. In such situations a formal synthesis of the evidence that is available from observational studies can be valuable whilst awaiting higher quality evidence from randomized trials. Consideration of randomized studies alone may be appropriate when assessing the efficacy of an intervention, but assessment of the effectiveness of such an intervention within a more general target population may be improved by consideration of evidence from non-randomized studies as well. Standard meta-analysis methods may allow for both within- and between-study heterogeneity; however when multiple sources of evidence are considered an extra level of complexity is introduced, namely study type. One possible solution to the problem of making inferences, particularly regarding an overall population effect, in such situations is to model the heterogeneity, both quantitative and qualitative, using a Bayesian hierarchical model. The hierarchical nature of such models specifically allows for the quantitative within and between sources of heterogeneity, whilst the Bayesian approach can accommodate a priori beliefs regarding qualitative differences between the various sources of evidence. The use of such methods in practice is illustrated in the context of screening for breast cancer; in this example evidence is available from both randomized clinical trials and observational studies. A particular appeal of a Bayesian approach for this type of problem lies in the prediction of future benefits likely to be observed in a target population. This approach to health service monitoring in general is discussed. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Then we consider noise terms to incorporate the fluctuation effects and the random import of the disease into the population and analyse the influence of heterogeneity on warning signs for critical transitions (or tipping points). This theory shows that one may be able to anticipate whether a bifurcation point is close before it happens. We use numerical simulations of a stochastic fast-slow heterogeneous population {SIS} model and show various aspects of heterogeneity have crucial influences on the scaling laws that are used as early-warning signs for the homogeneous system. Thus, although the basic structural qualitative dynamical properties are the same for both systems, the quantitative features for epidemic prediction are expected to change and care has to be taken to interpret potential warning signs for disease outbreaks correctly.},

In support of this change, the use of infection transmission models has entered the field of infection-related cancer epidemiology. These models are useful to understand the infection transmission processes, to estimate the key parameters that govern the spread of infection, and to project the potential impact of different preventive measures.

The objective of this study is to estimate a set of parameters revealing some of these unknown characteristics of {MCRC}. Methods. The authors developed a computer simulation model that mimics the progression of {MCRC} for a 5-year period following the treatment of primary colorectal cancer ({CRC}). They obtained the inputs of the simulation model using longitudinal data for 284 {CRC} patients from the Mayo Clinic, Rochester. Results. Five-year {MCRC} incidence and all-cause mortality were 7.4\% and 12.7\% in the patient cohort, respectively. Statistical analysis showed that 5-year {MCRC} incidence was associated with gender (P = 0.05), whereas both all-cause and {CRC}-related mortalities were associated with age (P {\textless} 0.001 and P = 0.01). Estimated annual probabilities of progression from adenomatous polyp to {MCRC} and from {MCRC} to metastatic {MCRC} were 0.14 and 0.28, respectively. Annual probabilities of mortality after {MCRC} and metastatic {MCRC} treatments were estimated to be 0.06 and 0.26, respectively. The estimated annual probability of mortality due to undetected {MCRC} was 0.16. Conclusions. The results imply that {MCRC}, especially in women, may be more common than suggested by previous studies. In addition, statistics derived from the clinical data and results of the simulation model indicate that gender and age affect the progression of {MCRC}.},

In reviewing the potential role for other vaccines against sexually transmitted infections ({STIs}) a series of questions needs to be addressed about the burden of disease, the potential characteristics of a new vaccine, and the impact of other interventions. These questions can be viewed in the light of the population dynamics of sexually transmitted infections as a group and how a vaccine can impact these dynamics. Mathematical models show the potential for substantial impact, especially if vaccines are widely used. To better make the case for sexually transmitted infection vaccines we need better data and analyses of the burden of disease, especially severe disease.

The authors discuss {MSM} goals, overall components of {MSMs}, methods for selecting {MSM} parameters to reproduce observed or expected results (calibration), methods for {MSM} checking (validation), and issues related to reporting and interpreting {MSM} findings(sensitivity analyses, reporting of variability, and model transparency). Conclusions. {MSMs} are increasingly being used to provide information to guide health policy decisions. This increased use brings with it the need for both better understanding of {MSMs} by policy researchers, and continued improvement in methods for developing and applying {MSMs}.},

The model system of differential equations also has a free virus compartment in the system, which infect normal cells. We analyze the local stability of the equilibrium points of the model and investigate the parameters, which play an important role in the progression toward invasive cancer. By simulation, we investigate the boundary between initial conditions of solutions, which tend to stable equilibrium point, representing controlled infection, and those which tend to unbounded growth of the cancer cell population.

	abstract = {This article develops and extends previous investigations on stochastic models for selecting examination schedules targeted at earlier diagnosis of chronic diseases. The general aim is to provide guidelines for public health programs in the choice of examination schedules. The main features of such schedules are the initial age to begin a scheduled examination program, the intervals between subsequent examinations, and the number of examinations. Our basic model consists of three health states: a disease-free or nondetectable state; a preclinical state, in which an individual has disease but is asymptomatic and is unaware of it; and a clinical state in which the disease has been diagnosed by routine methods. The aim of early detection programs is to identify individuals in a preclinical local state, which may result in higher cure rates or longer survival. We introduce two basic ideas that either individually or together can lead to satisfactory examinations schedules. The threshold method constructs examination schedules so that the probability of an individual being in the preclinical state is always bounded by a preselected value. The concept of schedule sensitivity is the ratio of the expected number of cases diagnosed on scheduled examinations to the expectation of the total number of cases. Combining the threshold and schedule sensitivity methods enables an assessment of the trade-offs with regard to the initial age at examination and cost per case found. All of these methods are extended to high-risk populations. The schedule sensitivity, cost per case diagnosed on a scheduled exam, and the total cost can be calculated for any early detection program. This enables comparisons of different strategies. We illustrate the applicability of our methods to scheduling examinations for female breast cancer.},

Prevention efforts might reduce {HIV} incidence but are unlikely to eliminate this disease. We investigated a theoretical strategy of universal voluntary {HIV} testing and immediate treatment with {ART}, and examined the conditions under which the {HIV} epidemic could be driven towards elimination. Methods We used mathematical models to explore the effect on the case reproduction number (stochastic model) and long-term dynamics of the {HIV} epidemic (deterministic transmission model) of testing all people in our test-case community (aged 15 years and older) for {HIV} every year and starting people on {ART} immediately after they are diagnosed {HIV} positive. We used data from South Africa as the test case for a generalised epidemic, and assumed that all {HIV} transmission was heterosexual. Findings The studied strategy could greatly accelerate the transition from the present endemic phase, in which most adults living with {HIV} are not receiving {ART}, to an elimination phase, in which most are on {ART}, within 5 years. it could reduce {HIV} incidence and mortality to less than one case per 1000 people per year by 2016, or within 10 years of full implementation of the strategy, and reduce the prevalence of {HIV} to less than 1\% within 50 years. We estimate that in 2032, the yearly cost of the present strategy and the theoretical strategy would both be {US}\$1.7 billion; however, after this time, the cost of the present strategy would continue to increase whereas that of the theoretical strategy would decrease. Interpretation Universal voluntary {HIV} testing and immediate {ART}, combined with present prevention approaches, could have a major effect on severe genralised {HIV}/{AIDS} epidemics. This approach merits further mathematical modelling, research, and broad consultation. Funding None.},

However, the long-term impact of vaccination is difficult to predict due to uncertainty about the prevalence of {HPV} infection, pattern of sexual partnerships, progression of cervical neoplasias, accuracy of screening as well as the duration of infectiousness and immunity. Dynamic models of human papillomavirus ({HPV}) transmission were developed to describe the infection spread and development of cervical neoplasia, cervical cancer (squamous cell and adenocarcinoma) and anogenital warts. Using different combinations of assumptions, 9900 scenarios were created. Each scenario was then fitted to epidemiological data and the best-fitting scenarios used to predict the impact of vaccination. Results suggest that vaccinating 12-year-old girls at 80\% coverage will result in a 38-82\% reduction in cervical cancer incidence and 44-100\% reduction in anogenital warts incidence after 60 years of an ongoing vaccination programme if vaccine protection lasts 20 years on average. The marginal benefit of vaccinating boys depends on the degree of protection achieved by vaccinating girls. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The introduction of the prostate-specific antigen ({PSA}) test has led to dramatic changes in the incidence of prostate cancer in the United States. In this article, we use information on the increase and subsequent decline in prostate cancer incidence following the adoption of {PSA} to estimate the lead time associated with {PSA} screening. The lead time is a key determinant of the likelihood of overdiagnosis, one of the main costs associated with the {PSA} test. Our approach conceptualizes observed incidence as the sum of the secular trend in incidence, which reflects incidence in the absence of {PSA}, and the excess incidence over and above the secular trend, which is a function of population screening patterns and the unknown lead time. We develop a likelihood model for the excess incidence given the secular trend and use it to estimate the mean lead time under specified distributional assumptions. We also develop a likelihood model for observed incidence and use it to simultaneously estimate the mean lead time together with a smooth secular trend. Variances and confidence intervals are estimated via a parametric bootstrap. Our results indicate an average lead time of approximately 4.59 years (95\% confidence interval [3.24, 5.93]) for whites and 6.78 years [5.42, 8.20] for blacks with a corresponding secular trend estimate that is fairly flat after the introduction of {PSA} screening. These estimates correspond to overdiagnosis frequencies of approximately 22.7\% and 34.4\% for screen-detected whites and blacks, respectively. Our results provide the first glimpse of a plausible secular trend in prostate cancer incidence and suggest that, in the absence of {PSA} screening, disease incidence would not have continued its historic increase, rather it would have leveled off in accordance with changes in prostate patterns of care unrelated to {PSA}.},

	abstract = {{HIV} transmission models have become very complex. The behavior of some of these models may only be explored by uncertainty and sensitivity analyses, because the structural complexity of the model are coupled with a high degree of uncertainty in estimating the values of the input parameters. Uncertainty analysis may be used to assess the variability (prediction imprecision) in the outcome variable that is due to the uncertainty in estimating the input values. A sensitivity analysis can extend an uncertainty analysis by identifying which parameters are important in contributing to the prediction imprecision (i.e., how do changes in the values of the input parameters alter the value of the outcome variable). In this paper an uncertainty and a sensitivity analysis are described and applied; both analyses are based upon the Latin Hypercube Sampling ({LHS}) scheme, which is an extremely efficient sampling design proposed by {McKay}, Conover \& Beckman (1979). The methods described in this paper have not previously been applied to deterministic models of disease transmission, although these models have many characteristics in common with the risk assessment models that the strategies were designed to investigate. The utility of the {LHS} uncertainty and the {LHS}/{PRC} (Latin Hypercube Sampling/Partial Rank Correlation) sensitivity analysis techniques are illustrated by analyzing a complex deterministic model of {HIV} transmission.},

Broader forms of synthesis have also been described, apparently re-invented in disparate fields, each time taking different computational approaches. The potential value of Bayesian estimation of a joint posterior parameter distribution and simultaneously sampling from it for decision analysis has also been appreciated. However, applications have been relatively few in number, sometimes stylized, and presented mainly to a statistical methods audience. As a result, the potential for multiparameter evidence synthesis in both epidemiology and health technology assessment has remained largely unrecognized. The advent of flexible software for Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo in the shape of {WinBUGS} has the made these earlier strands of work more widely available. Researchers can now carry out synthesis at a realistic level of complexity. The Bristol programme has not only contributed to a growing body of literature on how to synthesize different evidence structures, but also on how to check the consistency of multiple information sources and how to use the resulting models to prioritize future research.

Two conditions that can result in confounding by the subjects' partners are: (C1) partner choice is assortative by the risk factor examined and, (C2) sexual activity is associated with the risk factor. The objective of this paper is to illustrate the potential impact of the assortativity bias in studies examining {STI} risk factors, using smoking and human papillomavirus ({HPV}) as an example. We developed an {HPV} transmission-dynamic mathematical model in which we nested a cross-sectional study assessing the smoking-{HPV} association. In our base case, we assumed (1) no effect of smoking on {HPV}, and (2) conditions C1-C2 hold for smoking (based on empirical data). The assortativity bias caused an overestimation of the odds ratio ({OR}) in the simulated study after perfect adjustment for the subjects' individual-level characteristics (adjusted {OR} 1.51 instead of 1.00). The bias was amplified by a lower basic reproductive number (R-0), greater mixing assortativity and stronger association of smoking with sexual activity. Adjustment for characteristics of partners is needed to mitigate assortativity bias.},

	abstract = {Vaccines based on human papillomavirus ({HPV}) 16 and 18 virus-like particles have the potential to prevent similar to 70\% of cervical cancers. In Australia, public vaccination against {HPV} commenced in April 2007, and includes routine vaccination of females aged 12-13 years, and a 2-year school and {GP}-based catch-up in females age 12-26 years. The objectives of this study were to estimate initial vaccination coverage rates, to describe current patterns of sexual behavior in young females, and to predict the impact of vaccination on {HPV}16 infections. We reviewed early coverage data, estimating that coverage in 2007/2008 will reach 86\% (feasible range 67-90\%) for 12- to 13-year-old girls, with lower rates attained in older females. A review if survey data found that the median age of first intercourse in Australian females is 16 years, with similar to 90\% of women sexually active at 22 years. Using these data, we performed an analysis of {HPV} transmission to predict the impact of vaccination on {HPV} infection rates. The public program is predicted to result in a reduction in the age-standardized incidence of {HPV}16 infections of 56\% by 2010 (feasible range 48-61\%), and 92\% by 2050 (feasible range 76-95\%). Elective vaccination of older women and vaccination of males may provide some incremental gains, but the benefits to women of vaccinating males will be less if coverage of females remains high. In conclusion, the current vaccination program is expected to result in a substantial and rapid reduction in the incidence of {HPV}16 in Australia. (C) 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

	abstract = {Infection with human papillomavirus ({HPV}) is recognized as one of the major causes of infection-related cancer worldwide, as well as the causal factor in other diseases. Strong evidence for a causal etiology with {HPV} has been stated by the International Agency for Research on Cancer for cancers of the cervix uteri, penis, vulva, vagina, anus and oropharynx (including base of the tongue and tonsils). Of the estimated 12.7 million new cancers occurring in 2008 worldwide, 4.8\% were attributable to {HPV} infection, with substantially higher incidence and mortality rates seen in developing versus developed countries. In recent years, we have gained tremendous knowledge about {HPVs} and their interactions with host cells, tissues and the immune system; have validated and implemented strategies for safe and efficacious prophylactic vaccination against {HPV} infections; have developed increasingly sensitive and specific molecular diagnostic tools for {HPV} detection for use in cervical cancer screening; and have substantially increased global awareness of {HPV} and its many associated diseases in women, men, and children. While these achievements exemplify the success of biomedical research in generating important public health interventions, they also generate new and daunting challenges: costs of {HPV} prevention and medical care, the implementation of what is technically possible, socio-political resistance to prevention opportunities, and the very wide ranges of national economic capabilities and health care systems. Gains and challenges faced in the quest for comprehensive control of {HPV} infection and {HPV}-related cancers and other disease are summarized in this review. The information presented may be viewed in terms of a reframed paradigm of prevention of cervical cancer and other {HPV}-related diseases that will include strategic combinations of at least four major components: 1) routine introduction of {HPV} vaccines to women in all countries, 2) extension and simplification of existing screening programs using {HPV}-based technology, 3) extension of adapted screening programs to developing populations, and 4) consideration of the broader spectrum of cancers and other diseases preventable by {HPV} vaccination in women, as well as in men. Despite the huge advances already achieved, there must be ongoing efforts including international advocacy to achieve widespread optimally universal implementation of {HPV} prevention strategies in both developed and developing countries.

	abstract = {Numerous studies have attempted to quantify the number of breast cancers that would never have been diagnosed in the absence of screening. Unfortunately, results are highly variable across studies and there is considerable disagreement about both the frequency of overdiagnosis and the validity of different methodologic approaches. In this Commentary, we review limitations of the two major approaches used in existing studies. Studies that use excess incidence as a proxy for overdiagnosis require a valid estimate of incidence in the absence of screening and sufficient follow-up to ensure the excess excludes relevant (ie, nonoverdiagnosed) cancers detected early. The requirement of sufficient follow-up applies to both population studies and clinical trials, but only certain clinical trial designs have the potential to yield unbiased results. Studies that model disease natural history to infer overdiagnosis must, in addition, examine whether their models produce valid estimates in the presence of nonprogressive cases. In this setting, limited follow-up could lead to a lack of identifiability of the parameters needed to accurately infer overdiagnosis. In a polarized research community, the excess incidence and modeling approaches are generally viewed as competitors, but we argue that they are complementary, with models being more complex but having greater potential to inform about disease natural history and the outcomes of candidate screening policies. Rather than arguing why one approach should be preferred to another, investigators should focus on developing studies that generate reliable estimates of overdiagnosis. Recognizing that both approaches have limitations, which existing studies rarely overcome, is a first step towards reconciling methodologic perspectives and achieving consensus about the real magnitude of the overdiagnosis problem.},

This approach consists of systematic use of tumor size at detection, combining stochastic models of tumor latency, tumor growth and turner detection, and employing a new biologically natural screening efficiency criterion defined as the Kantorovich distance between the tumor size at spontaneous detection in the absence of screening and the tumor size at detection when both spontaneous and screening based mechanisms are in place.

	abstract = {Transmission dynamic models linked to economic analyses often form part of the decision making process when introducing new chlamydia screening interventions. Outputs from these transmission dynamic models can vary depending on the values of the parameters used to describe the infection. Therefore these values can have an important influence on policy and resource allocation. The risk of progression from infection to pelvic inflammatory disease has been extensively studied but the parameters which govern the transmission dynamics are frequently neglected. We conducted a systematic review of transmission dynamic models linked to economic analyses of chlamydia screening interventions to critically assess the source and variability of the proportion of infections that are asymptomatic, the duration of infection and the transmission probability. We identified nine relevant studies in Pubmed, Embase and the Cochrane database. We found that there is a wide variation in their natural history parameters, including an absolute difference in the proportion of asymptomatic infections of 25\% in women and 75\% in men, a six-fold difference in the duration of asymptomatic infection and a four-fold difference in the per act transmission probability. We consider that much of this variation can be explained by a lack of consensus in the literature. We found that a significant proportion of parameter values were referenced back to the early chlamydia literature, before the introduction of nucleic acid modes of diagnosis and the widespread testing of asymptomatic individuals. In conclusion, authors should use high quality contemporary evidence to inform their parameter values, clearly document their assumptions and make appropriate use of sensitivity analysis. This will help to make models more transparent and increase their utility to policy makers.},

A comprehensive analysis of the asymptotic behaviour of the disease is given, based on an explicit aggregation of the model. The results are compared with those of a homogeneous version of the model to highlight the influence of the heterogeneity on the asymptotics. Moreover, the performed analysis reveals in which cases incomplete information about the heterogeneity of the population is sufficient in order to determine the long-run outcome of the disease. Numerical simulation is used to emphasize that, for a given level of prevalence, the evolution of the disease under the influence of heterogeneity may in the long run qualitatively differ from the one 'predicted' by the homogeneous model. Furthermore, it is shown that, in a closed population, the indicator for the survival of the population is in the presence of heterogeneity distinct from the basic reproduction number.},

An increasing incidence of anal cancer among men suggests a need to better understand anal canal human papillomavirus ({HPV}) infection among human immunodeficiency virus negative men. Methods.

Factors associated with anal {HPV} infection were assessed using multivariable logistic regression. Results. The prevalence of any {HPV} type and oncogenic {HPV} types did not differ by city.

Among {MSM}, a younger age, reporting 2 male anal sex partners in the past 3 months, and never using a condom for anal sex in the past 6 months were independently associated with detection of any anal {HPV} in multivariable analysis. Conclusions. Number of sex partners was associated with anal {HPV} infection in both {MSW} and {MSM}.

This study investigates seroprevalence of {HPV} 6, 11, 16, and 18, and associated risk factors in men residing in three countries (United States, Mexico, and Brazil).
Methods: Data from 1,477 men aged 18 to 70 enrolled in the {HPV} Infection in Men Study ({HIM} Study) were analyzed. Serum antibody testing was performed with virus-like particle-based {ELISA}. Potential risk factors were assessed for individual {HPV} types by the use of logistic regression.
Results: Overall, {HPV}-6, 11, 16, and 18 seroprevalence was 14.8\%, 17.3\%, 11.2\%, and 5.8\%, respectively. Thirty-four percent of men were seropositive to one or more {HPV} types. When examined by sexual practice, 31.2\% of men who had sex with women, 65.6\% of men who had sex with men ({MSM}), and 59.4\% of men who had sex with both men and women ({MSMW}) were seropositive to one or more {HPV} types. Seroprevalence increased with age among young-to-middle-aged men with significant upward age trends observed for {HPV} 11, 16, and 18. Men with multiple lifetime male anal sex partners were 2 to 4 times more likely to be {HPV} 6 or 11 seropositive and 3 to 11 times more likely to be {HPV} 16 or 18 seropositive.
Conclusion: Our data indicate that exposures to vaccine {HPV} types were common in men and highly prevalent among {MSM} and {MSMW}.
Impact: Our study provides strong evidence that the practice of same-sex anal intercourse is an independent risk factor for seroprevalence of individual vaccine {HPV} types. Examination of antibody responses to {HPV} infections at various anatomic sites in future studies is needed to elaborate on the mechanism.

	abstract = {Background: Metastatic disease is a major morbidity of prostate cancer ({PCa}). Its prevention is an important goal. Objective: To assess the effect of screening for {PCa} on the incidence of metastatic disease in a randomized trial. Design, setting, and participants: Data were available for 76 813 men aged 55-69 yr coming from four centers of the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer ({ERSPC}). The presence of metastatic disease was evaluated by imaging or by prostate-specific antigen ({PSA}) values {\textgreater} 100 ng/ml at diagnosis and during follow-up. Intervention: Regular screening based on serum {PSA} measurements was offered to 36 270 men randomized to the screening arm, while no screening was provided to the 40 543 men in the control arm. Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: The Nelson-Aalen technique and Poisson regression were used to calculate cumulative incidence and rate ratios of M+ disease. Results and limitations: After a median follow-up of 12 yr, 666 men with M+ {PCa} were detected, 256 in the screening arm and 410 in the control arm, resulting in cumulative incidence of 0.67\% and 0.86\% per 1000 men, respectively (p {\textless} 0.001). This finding translated into a relative reduction of 30\% (hazard ratio [{HR}]: 0.70; 95\% confidence interval [{CI}], 0.60-0.82; p = 0.001) in the intention-to-screen analysis and a 42\% (p = 0.0001) reduction for men who were actually screened. An absolute risk reduction of metastatic disease of 3.1 per 1000 men randomized (0.31\%) was found. A large discrepancy was seen when comparing the rates of M+ detected at diagnosis and all M+ cases that emerged during the total follow-up period, a 50\% reduction ({HR}: 0.50; 95\% {CI}, 0.41-0.62) versus the 30\% reduction. The main limitation is incomplete explanation of the lack of an effect of screening during follow-up. Conclusions: {PSA} screening significantly reduces the risk of developing metastatic {PCa}. However, despite earlier diagnosis with screening, certain men still progress and develop metastases. The {ERSPC} trial is registered under number {ISRCTN}49127736.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Advances in {HIV} prevention methods offer promise to accelerate declines in incidence, but how these methods can be deployed to have the best effect on the heterogeneous landscape and drivers of the pandemic remains unclear. We postulated that use of epidemic heterogeneity to inform the allocation of resources for combination {HIV} prevention could enhance the impact of {HIV} funding across sub-Saharan Africa.
{METHODS}: We developed a compartmental mathematical model of {HIV} transmission and disease progression by risk group to subnational resolution in 18 countries, capturing 80\% of the adult {HIV} burden in sub-Saharan Africa. Adults aged 15-49 years were grouped by risk of {HIV} acquisition and transmission, and those older than 50 years were assumed to have negligible risk. For each top-level administrative division, we calibrated the model to historical data for {HIV} prevalence, sexual behaviours, treatment scale-up, and demographics. We then evaluated four strategies for allocation of prevention funding over a 15 year period from 2016 to 2030, which exploited epidemic differences between subnational regions to varying degrees.
{FINDINGS}: For a \${US}20 billion representative expenditure over the 15 year period, scale-up of prevention along present funding channels could avert 5·3 million infections relative to no scale-up. Prioritisation of key populations could avert 3·7 million more infections than present funding channels, and additional prioritisation by within-country geography could avert 400 000 more infections. Removal of national constraints could avert a further 600 000 infections. Risk prioritisation has greater marginal impact than geographical prioritisation across multiple expenditure levels. However, targeting by both risk and geography is best for total impact and could achieve gains of up to three times more than present channels. A shift from the present pattern to the optimum pattern would rebalance resources towards more cost-effective interventions and emerging epidemics.
{INTERPRETATION}: If domestic and international funders were to align strategically to build an aggregate funding pattern that is guided by the epidemiology of {HIV}, and particularly by the emerging understanding of local dynamics and epidemic drivers, more cost-effective and impactful {HIV} prevention investments could be achieved across sub-Saharan Africa.

Bivalent and quadrivalent {HPV} vaccines protect against 66\% of {HPV}-associated cervical cancers, and a new nonavalent vaccine protects against an additional 15\% of cervical cancers. However, vaccination policy varies across states, and migration between states interdependently dilutes state-specific vaccination policies. To quantify the economic and epidemiological impacts of switching to the nonavalent vaccine both for individual states and for the nation as a whole, we developed a model of {HPV} transmission and cervical cancer incidence that incorporates state-specific demographic dynamics, sexual behavior, and migratory patterns. At the national level, the nonavalent vaccine was shown to be cost-effective compared with the bivalent and quadrivalent vaccines at any coverage despite the greater per-dose cost of the new vaccine. Furthermore, the nonavalent vaccine remains cost-effective with up to an additional 40\% coverage of the adolescent population, representing 80\% of girls and 62\% of boys. We find that expansion of coverage would have the greatest health impact in states with the lowest coverage because of the decreasing marginal returns of herd immunity. Our results show that if policies promoting nonavalent vaccine implementation and expansion of coverage are coordinated across multiple states, all states benefit both in health and in economic terms.},

	abstract = {Decision analytic models used for health technology assessment are subject to uncertainties. These uncertainties can be quantified probabilistically, by placing distributions on model parameters and simulating from these to generate estimates of cost-effectiveness. However, many uncertain model choices, often termed structural assumptions, are usually only explored informally by presenting estimates of cost-effectiveness under alternative scenarios. The authors show how 2 recent research proposals represent parts of a framework to formally account for all common structural uncertainties. First, the model is expanded to include parameters that encompass all possible structural choices. Uncertainty can then arise because these parameters are estimated imprecisely from data, for example, a treatment effect of doubtful significance. Uncertainty can also arise if there are no relevant data. If there are relevant data, uncertainty can be addressed by averaging expected costs and effects generated from probabilistic analysis of the models with and without the parameter. The weights used for averaging are related to the predictive ability of each model, assessed against the data. If there are no data, additional parameters can often be informed by eliciting expert beliefs as probability distributions. These ideas are illustrated in decision models for antiplatelet therapies for vascular disease and new biologic drugs for the treatment of active psoriatic arthritis.},

The structure of optimal screening policies is investigated as well as the benefit they can provide compared to the periodic screening policy. The detection probability is assumed to depend only on the stage of the disease, though it may not be constant throughout each stage. It is shown that periodic screening appears to be optimal when one has no information on the natural history of the disease, the minimum delay time criterion being used for optimization.

Evidence on the cost-effectiveness of the nonavalent is required for timely policy-decisions. We compared the potential cost-effectiveness of the nonavalent and quadrivalent {HPV} vaccines. We used a multitype individual-based transmission-dynamic model of {HPV} infection and diseases, 70-year time-horizon, 3\% discount rate and healthcare payer perspective. We calibrated the model to Canadian sexual behavior and epidemiologic data, and estimated Quality-Adjusted Life-Years ({QALYs}) lost and costs (\${CAN} 2010) from the literature. Under base-case assumptions (vaccinating 10-year-old girls, 80\% coverage, 95\$/dose, vaccine-type efficacy = 95\%, cross-protection for the quadrivalent vaccine, duration of vaccine-type protection (cross-protection) = 20 (10) years), using the quadrivalent and nonavalent vaccines is estimated to cost \$15,528 [12,056; 19,140] and \$12,203 [9,331; 17,292] per {QALY}-gained, respectively. At equal price, the nonavalent vaccine is more cost-effective than the quadrivalent vaccine, even when assuming both shorter duration of protection (nonavalent = 20 years vs. quadrivalent = lifelong) and lower vaccine-type efficacy (nonavalent = 85\% vs. quadrivalent = 95\%). However, the additional cost per dose of the nonavalent vaccine should not exceed \$11 to remain more cost-effective than the quadrivalent vaccine, and \$24 to represent a cost-effective alternative to the quadrivalent vaccine (using a \$40,000/{QALY}-gained threshold). The nonavalent vaccine can be a cost-effective alternative to the quadrivalent vaccine, even in scenarios where nonavalent vaccine efficacy is 85\%. However, because most cervical cancers are caused by {HPV}-16/18, it is unlikely that the nonavalent would be used if its efficacy against these types is lower than current {HPV} vaccines.},

	abstract = {Introduction   Concerns about risk compensation—increased risk behaviours in response to a perception of reduced {HIV} transmission risk—after the initiation of {ART} have largely been dispelled in empirical studies, but other changes in sexual networking patterns may still modify the effects of {ART} on {HIV} incidence.       Methods   We developed an exploratory mathematical model of {HIV} transmission that incorporates the possibility of {ART} clusters, i.e. subsets of the sexual network in which the density of {ART} patients is much higher than in the rest of the network. Such clusters may emerge as a result of {ART} homophily—a tendency for {ART} patients to preferentially form and maintain relationships with other {ART} patients. We assessed whether {ART} clusters may affect the impact of {ART} on {HIV} incidence, and how the influence of this effect-modifying variable depends on contextual variables such as {HIV} prevalence, {HIV} serosorting, coverage of {HIV} testing and {ART}, and adherence to {ART}.       Results   {ART} homophily can modify the impact of {ART} on {HIV} incidence in both directions. In concentrated epidemics and generalized epidemics with moderate {HIV} prevalence (≈ 10\%), {ART} clusters can enhance the impact of {ART} on {HIV} incidence, especially when adherence to {ART} is poor. In hyperendemic settings (≈ 35\% {HIV} prevalence), {ART} clusters can reduce the impact of {ART} on {HIV} incidence when adherence to {ART} is high but few people living with {HIV} ({PLWH}) have been diagnosed. In all contexts, the effects of {ART} clusters on {HIV} epidemic dynamics are distinct from those of {HIV} serosorting.       Conclusions   Depending on the programmatic and epidemiological context, {ART} clusters may enhance or reduce the impact of {ART} on {HIV} incidence, in contrast to serosorting, which always leads to a lower impact of {ART} on {HIV} incidence. {ART} homophily and the emergence of {ART} clusters should be measured empirically and incorporated into more refined models used to plan and evaluate {ART} programmes.},

Modeling the preclinical sojourn time distribution as a piecewise density function results in robust estimation of the distribution function. Our aim is to estimate the piecewise density function and the examination sensitivity using both generalized least squares and maximum likelihood methods.

We examined this issue with three fundamentally different approaches: (i) Chronologythe temporal relationship of the onset of breast cancer mortality decline and the national implementation of screening mammography; (ii) Magnitudethe degree to which breast cancer mortality declined relative to the amount (penetration) of screening mammography; (iii) Analogythe pattern of mortality rate reductions of other cancers for which population screening is not conducted. Chronology and magnitude were assessed with data from Europe and North America, with three methods applied to magnitude. A comparison of eight countries in Europe and North America does not demonstrate a correlation between the penetration of national screening and either the chronology or magnitude of national breast cancer mortality reduction. In the United States, the magnitude of the mortality decline is greater in the unscreened, younger women than in the screened population and regional variation in the rate of breast cancer mortality reduction is not correlated with screening penetrance, either as self-reported or by the magnitude of screening-induced increase in early-stage disease. Analogy analysis of United States data identifies 14 other cancers with a similar distinct onset of mortality reduction for which screening is not performed. These five lines of evidence from three different approaches and additional observations discussed do not support the hypothesis that mammography screening is a primary reason for the breast cancer mortality reduction in Europe and North America. What's new? Deaths from breast cancer have declined steeply since the 1990s, though although the reasons for this progress remain unclear. The role of screening mammography, presumably the most effective breast cancer screening modality, has been notably enigmatic and controversial. Its effectiveness is further drawn into question here, in which scrutiny of data from eight countries in Europe and North America indicates that screening mammography has little impact on breast cancer mortality reduction. Screening mammography correlated with neither the onset nor magnitude of mortality declines. Indeed, advances in treatment likely have had a greater relative impact on breast cancer survival.},

	volume = {88},

	doi = {10.2307/2290344},
	abstract = {Several chronic diseases are characterized by an initial asymptomatic stage during which, if detected by screening, they can be cured in a more effective way. This article considers two statistical design problems in screening for chronic disease: the choice of examination ages and the choice of the part of the population to be screened. One main goal is capturing the trade-off between the costs of examination and the losses due to late detection, while accounting for the effects of age on the incidence of the disease, on mortality, and on the relative advantages of early detection. The problem is posed in a decision theoretic way. The model adopted considers a single individual, whose history relative to the disease is represented by a discrete-valued stochastic process. The transition structure is general, but known. The decision space includes all sequences of examination times, as well as no examination. The optimality criterion accounts for the cost of examinations and, in a general way, for the goals of screening in terms of mortality and morbidity. So the optimality criterion may depend on survival, quality-adjusted life years, cost of care, and so on, as well as on combinations of these factors. A general solution and computational algorithms are derived by extending to this context methodologies developed in reliability theory. The case in which the test used for screening has high sensitivity is studied in detail; then the determination of the optimal schedule and stopping rule is reduced to a one-dimensional optimization problem by recursive dynamic methods. Moreover, sufficient conditions for screening to be increasingly worthwhile with age are derived. Under these conditions, the optimal number of planned examinations is either 0 or infinity, and there is a simple check to establish whether or not to screen without having to compute the optimal schedule. Under slightly stronger conditions, the times between examinations decrease and the optimal solution is unique and easy to compute. The conditions mentioned relate increasing times between checks to properties of the failure rate of the time to onset of the disease and of the relative incidence of the disease. Applications of the results include developing guidelines for screening for breast and cervical cancers-currently a controversial issue.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces the notion of a multiattribute utility tree. This graphical representation decomposes the von Neumann-Morgenstern utility of a multiattribute consequence into a sum of products of indifference probability assessments of binary gambles. The utility tree displays the sequence of gambles required to elicit the utility value of a consequence. In addition, it enables the analyst to conduct consistency checks on the indifference assessments provided by the decision maker and to change the order of the assessments based on her comfort level. Once the indifference assessments are provided, the utility value of a consequence can be obtained by direct rollback analysis. On a continuous domain, the utility tree decomposes the functional form of a multiattribute utility function into a sum of products of normalized conditional utility functions. Each attribute in the expansion is conditioned on the boundary values of the attributes expanded before it. This formulation provides a general method for deriving the functional form of a multiattribute utility function under a wide variety of conditions. It also leads to several new independence concepts such as "boundary independence," which is a weaker condition than utility independence, and "corner independence," which makes higher-order independence assertions. Reversing the order of the nodes in the tree relates several widely used notions of utility independence found in the literature.},

Design.-Nested case-control study of men providing plasma samples before a 10-year follow-up. Setting.-The Physicians' Health Study, an ongoing randomized trial that enrolled 22071 men aged 40 to 84 years in 1982. Participants.-A total of 366 men (cases) diagnosed with prostate cancer and 1098 men (three controls per case), matched by age, randomly selected from all cohort members at risk at the time of case diagnosis. Main Outcome Measures.-Sensitivity and specificity for each year of followup and for aggressive and nonaggressive cancers separately. Results.-At a cutoff of 4.0 ng/{mL}, sensitivity for the entire 10-year follow-up was 46\% for total cases. Sensitivities for detection of total, aggressive, and nonaggressive cancers occurring in the first 4 years were 73\%, 87\%, and 53\%. Overall, specificity was 91\% and changed little by year of follow-up. Optimal validity was achieved at a cutoff of 3.3 ng/{mL}, Estimated mean lead time for all cancers was 5.5 years. Only 40\% of cancers detected more than 5 years from baseline were nonaggressive. Compared with men with {PSA} levels less than 1.0 ng/{mL}, those with {PSA} levels between 2.0 and 3.0 ng/{mL} had an {RR} of 5.5 (95\% confidence interval, 3.7 to 9.2). Conclusions.-A single {PSA} measurement had a relatively high sensitivity and specificity for detection of prostate cancers that arose within 4 years. prostate-specific antigen values less than the usual cutoff were associated with substantial increases in risk compared with the lowest levels. Final evaluation of {PSA} screening must also consider cost and the ability of current treatments to improve the prognosis of screen-detected cases.},

It is widely believed that the core group is important in the persistence of infection and that it provides a sensible target for control interventions. Goal of this study and study design: Simple mathematical models are used to assess the significance of sexual mixing between core and noncore groups. Published data from contact tracing studies, which base the definition of the core group on gonorrhea incidence by area of residence, are used to derive estimates of the degree of mixing within and between groups. Results: Analyses reveal patterns of high mixing within core groups in the urban study sites, which suggests that within-group transmission ensures the persistence of gonococcal infection in the community as a whole.

	abstract = {Background: Many koala populations around Australia are in serious decline, with a substantial component of this decline in some Southeast Queensland populations attributed to the impact of Chlamydia. A Chlamydia vaccine for koalas is in development and has shown promise in early trials. This study contributes to implementation preparedness by simulating vaccination strategies designed to reverse population decline and by identifying which age and sex category it would be most effective to target. Methods: We used field data to inform the development and parameterisation of an individual-based stochastic simulation model of a koala population endemic with Chlamydia. The model took into account transmission, morbidity and mortality caused by Chlamydia infections. We calibrated the model to characteristics of typical Southeast Queensland koala populations. As there is uncertainty about the effectiveness of the vaccine in real-world settings, a variety of potential vaccine efficacies, half-lives and dosing schedules were simulated. Results: Assuming other threats remain constant, it is expected that current population declines could be reversed in around 5-6 years if female koalas aged 1-2 years are targeted, average vaccine protective efficacy is 75\%, and vaccine coverage is around 10\% per year. At lower vaccine efficacies the immunological effects of boosting become important: at 45\% vaccine efficacy population decline is predicted to reverse in 6 years under optimistic boosting assumptions but in 9 years under pessimistic boosting assumptions. Terminating a successful vaccination programme at 5 years would lead to a rise in Chlamydia prevalence towards pre-vaccination levels. Conclusion: For a range of vaccine efficacy levels it is projected that population decline due to endemic Chlamydia can be reversed under realistic dosing schedules, potentially in just 5 years. However, a vaccination programme might need to continue indefinitely in order to maintain Chlamydia prevalence at a sufficiently low level for population growth to continue. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Gonorrhoea continues to be a public health problem in the {UK}, and is the second most common bacterial sexually transmitted infection ({STI}) after chlamydia. In the {UK}, gonorrhoea is disproportionately concentrated in epidemiologically distinct subpopulations, with much higher incidence rates in young people, some ethnic minorities and inner city subpopulations. The original model of {STI} transmission proposed by Hethcote and Yorke explained some of these features through the concept of the 'core group'. Since then, several authors have modified the original model approach to include multiple sexual activity classes, but found this modelling approach to be inadequate when applied to low-prevalence settings such as the {UK}. We present a metapopulation framework for modelling gonorrhoea and other {STIs}. The model proposes that the epidemiology of gonorrhoea is largely driven by subpopulations with higher than average concentrations of individuals with high sexual risk activity. We show how this conceptualization of gonococcal epidemiology overcomes key limitations associated with some of the prior efforts to model gonorrhoea. We also use the model to explain several epidemiological features of gonorrhoea, such as its asymmetric distribution across subpopulations, and the contextual risk experienced by members of at-risk subpopulations. Finally, we extend the model to explain the distribution of other {STIs}, using chlamydia as an example of a more ubiquitous bacterial {STI}.},

A common model is described, taking the form of a linear regression for both fixed and random effects synthesis, which can be implemented with normal, binomial, Poisson, and multinomial data. The familiar logistic model for meta-analysis with binomial data is a generalized linear model with a logit link function, which is appropriate for probability outcomes. The same linear regression framework can be applied to continuous outcomes, rate models, competing risks, or ordered category outcomes by using other link functions, such as identity, log, complementary log-log, and probit link functions. The common core model for the linear predictor can be applied to pairwise meta-analysis, indirect comparisons, synthesis of multiarm trials, and mixed treatment comparisons, also known as network meta-analysis, without distinction. We take a Bayesian approach to estimation and provide {WinBUGS} program code for a Bayesian analysis using Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation. An advantage of this approach is that it is straightforward to extend to shared parameter models where different randomized controlled trials report outcomes in different formats but from a common underlying model. Use of the generalized linear model framework allows us to present a unified account of how models can be compared using the deviance information criterion and how goodness of fit can be assessed using the residual deviance. The approach is illustrated through a range of worked examples for commonly encountered evidence formats.},

With the emergence of ever more biomarkers for cancer risk prediction and the development of personalized medicine, there is a need for risk-specific screening intervals. The interval between successive screens should be shorter with increasing cancer risk. A risk-dependent optimal interval is ideally derived from a cost-effectiveness analysis using a validated simulation model. However, this is time-consuming and costly. We propose a simplified mathematical approach for the exploratory analysis of the implications of risk level on optimal screening interval. We develop a mathematical model of the optimal screening interval for breast cancer screening. We verified the results by programming the simplified model in the {MISCAN}-Breast microsimulation model and comparing the results. We validated the results by comparing them with the results of a full, published {MISCAN}-Breast cost-effectiveness model for a number of different risk levels. The results of both the verification and validation were satisfactory. We conclude that the mathematical approach can indicate the impact of disease risk on the optimal screening interval.},

The model was analysed to clarify the relationship between heterosexual and {IVDU} transmission and to provide qualitative and quantitative insights into the {HIV} epidemic in {NYC}. The results demonstrated the significance of the dynamic interaction of heterosexual and {IVDU} transmission. Scenario analysis of the model was used to suggest a new explanation for the stabilization of the seroprevalence level that has been observed in the {NYC} {IVDU} community; the proposed explanation does not rely upon any {IVDU} or sexual behavioural changes. Gender-specific risks of heterosexual transmission in {IVDUs} were also explored by scenario analysis. The results showed that the effect of the heterosexual transmission risk factor on increasing the risk of {HIV} infection depends upon the level of {IVDU}. The model was used to predict future numbers of adult and pediatric {AIDS} cases; a sensitivity analysis of the model showed that the confidence intervals on these prediction estimates were extremely wide. This prediction variability was due to the uncertainty in estimating the values of the models' thirty variables (twenty biological-behavioural transmission parameters and the initial sizes of ten subgroups). However, the sensitivity analysis revealed that only a few key variables were significant in contributing to the {AIDS} case prediction variability; partial rank correlation coefficients were calculated and used to identify and to rank the importance of these key variables. The results suggest that long-term precise estimates of the future number of {AIDS} cases will only be possible once the values of these key variables have been evaluated accurately.},

	abstract = {Background: The risk of infection with human papillomavirus ({HPV}) increases with age. Answering the question of which age groups are appropriate to target for catch-up vaccination with the newly licensed quadrivalent {HPV} vaccine (types 6/11/16/18) will be important for developing vaccine policy recommendations. Objectives: To assess the value of varying female {HPV} vaccination strategies by specific age groups of a catch-up program in the United States. Methods: The authors used previously published mathematical population dynamic model and cost-utility analysis to evaluate the public health impact and cost-effectiveness of alternative quadrivalent {HPV} (6/11/16/18) vaccination strategies. The model simulates heterosexual transmission of {HPV} infection and occurrence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia ({CIN}), cervical cancer, and external genital warts in an age-structured population stratified by sex and sexual activity groups. The cost-utility analysis estimates the cost of vaccination, screening, diagnosis, and treatment of {HPV} diseases, and quality-adjusted survival. Results: Compared with the current screening practices, vaccinating girls and women ages 12 to 24 years was the most effective strategy, reducing the number of {HPV}6/11/16/18-related genital warts, {CIN} grades 2 and 3, and cervical cancer cases among women in the next 25 years by 3,049,285, 1,399,935, and 30,021; respectively. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of this strategy when compared with vaccinating girls and women ages 12 to 19 years was \$10,986 per quality-adjusted life-year gained. Conclusion: Relative to other commonly accepted health-care programs, vaccinating girls and women ages 12 to 24 years appears cost-effective.},

	abstract = {Background The European Randomised study of Screening for Prostate Cancer ({ERSPC}) has shown significant reductions in prostate cancer mortality after 9 years and 11 years of follow-up, but screening is controversial because of adverse events such as overdiagnosis. We provide updated results of mortality from prostate cancer with follow-up to 2010, with analyses truncated at 9, 11, and 13 years. Methods {ERSPC} is a multicentre, randomised trial with a predefined centralised database, analysis plan, and core age group (55-69 years), which assesses prostate-specific antigen ({PSA}) testing in eight European countries. Eligible men aged 50-74 years were identified from population registries and randomly assigned by computer generated random numbers to screening or no intervention (control). Investigators were masked to group allocation. The primary outcome was prostate cancer mortality in the core age group. Analysis was by intention to treat. We did a secondary analysis that corrected for selection bias due to non-participation. Only incidence and no mortality data at 9 years' follow-up are reported for the French centres. This study is registered with Current Controlled Trials, number {ISRCTN}49127736. Findings With data truncated at 13 years of follow-up, 7408 prostate cancer cases were diagnosed in the intervention group and 6107 cases in the control group. The rate ratio of prostate cancer incidence between the intervention and control groups was 1.91 (95\% {CI} 1.83-1.99) after 9 years (1.64 [1.58-1.69] including France), 1.66 (1.60-1.73) after 11 years, and 1.57 (1.51-1.62) after 13 years. The rate ratio of prostate cancer mortality was 0.85 (0.70-1.03) after 9 years, 0.78 (0.66-0.91) after 11 years, and 0.79 (0.69-0.91) at 13 years. The absolute risk reduction of death from prostate cancer at 13 years was 0.11 per 1000 person-years or 1.28 per 1000 men randomised, which is equivalent to one prostate cancer death averted per 781 (95\% {CI} 490-1929) men invited for screening or one per 27 (17-66) additional prostate cancer detected. After adjustment for non-participation, the rate ratio of prostate cancer mortality in men screened was 0.73 (95\% {CI} 0.61-0.88). Interpretation In this update the {ERSPC} confirms a substantial reduction in prostate cancer mortality attributable to testing of {PSA}, with a substantially increased absolute effect at 13 years compared with findings after 9 and 11 years. Despite our findings, further quantification of harms and their reduction are still considered a prerequisite for the introduction of populated-based screening.},

	abstract = {{IntroductionSexually} transmitted infections ({STIs}) are major causes of medical and psychological problems globally, while adolescents in South Korea have recently shown rapid changes in sexual behaviors. {AimsWe} aimed to examine the association between the age of first sexual intercourse and the experience of {STIs} among adolescents. Additionally, in which specific time period would more likely to get infected from sexual intercourse. {MethodsWe} used data from the 2007-2013 Korea Youth Risk Behavior Web-based Survey. Only adolescents with sexual intercourse experience (N=22,381) were included, and multiple logistic regression analysis was performed. Main Outcome {MeasuresOne} dichotomized measure and one continuous measure were assessed: (i) {STIs} experience (defined as having had {STIs}); and (ii) association between {STIs} experience and absolute age gap (defined as temporal differences between secondary sexual character emergence age and first sexual intercourse age). {ResultsApproximately} 7.4\% of boys and 7.5\% of girls reported had {STI}. For both boys and girls, the chance of experiencing {STIs} increased as the age of first sexual intercourse decreased (boys: before elementary school [age 7 or under]: odds ratio [{OR}]=10.81, first grade [age 7 or 8]: {OR}=4.44, second grade [age 8 or 9]: {OR}=8.90, fourth grade [age 10 or 11]: {OR}=7.20, ninth grade [age 15 or 16]: {OR}=2.31; girls: before elementary school: {OR}=18.09, first grade: {OR}=7.26, second grade: {OR}=7.12, fourth grade: {OR}=8.93, ninth grade: {OR}=2.74). The association between the absolute age gap and {STI} experience was examined additionally (boys: {OR}=0.93, girls: {OR}=0.87). {ConclusionsThis} study shows that earlier initiation of sexual intercourse increases the odds of experiencing {STIs}. Also as the age gap gets shorter, the odds of experiencing {STIs} increase. Our study suggests that it is important to consider the time period of first sexual intercourse and to reinforce a monitoring system along with the development of other preventive strategies.

	issn = {0269-9370},
	abstract = {Objective: To determine the extent to which men provide a bridge population between, commercial sex workers ({CSW}) and the general female population in Thailand. Design: Sexual network and serological data were collected from a systematic quota sample of low income men and truckers during 1992 in three Thailand provinces. Completed sample size was 1075 men aged 17-45 years and 330 truckers. Methods: Sexual network information was used to identify those men who have sex with both female {CSW} and non-{CSW} partners (the 'bridge population'). A new method was used for calculating the partner acquisition rate and to establish the potential number of women exposed to {HIV} via inconsistent condom use among the bridge population. Results: Approximately 17\% of men and 25\% of truckers can be included in the bridge population. These men are more likely to be {HIV}-positive and to have had at least one other sexually transmitted infection in the past year (odds ratio, 2.2 and 3.4, respectively). Consistent condom use with {CSW} is less than 30\%, and is less than 1\% with non-{CSW} partners. As a result, 30 women in the general population were potentially exposed to {HIV} per 100 sexually active men in the last year: nine women each additional year. Younger men and truckers expose almost twice as many women to {HIV}; more female peers than wives are exposed. Conclusion: Bridge populations may be as important as 'core groups' for the spread of {HIV} into the general Thai population. Young men and women are strategic intervention targets because they have more partners, are more likely to be in bridging networks, and are more receptive to condom use.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.vaccine.2012.06.091},
	abstract = {Over the last 5 years, prophylactic vaccination against human papillomavirus ({HPV}) in pre-adolescent females has been introduced in most developed countries, supported by modeled evaluations that have almost universally found vaccination of pre-adolescent females to be cost-effective. Studies to date suggest that vaccination of pre-adolescent males may also be cost-effective at a cost per vaccinated individual of similar to {US}\$400-500 if vaccination coverage in females cannot be increased above similar to 50\%; but if it is possible, increasing coverage in females appears to be a better return on investment. Comparative evaluation of the quadrivalent ({HPV}16,18,6,11) and bivalent ({HPV}16,18) vaccines centers around the potential trade-off between protection against anogenital warts and vaccine-specific levels of cross-protection against infections not targeted by the vaccines. Future evaluations will also need to consider the cost-effectiveness of a next generation nonavalent vaccine designed to protect against similar to 90\% of cervical cancers. The timing of the effect of vaccination on cervical screening programs will be country-specific and will depend on vaccination catch-up age range and coverage and the age at which screening starts. Initial evaluations suggest that if screening remains unchanged, it will be less cost-effective in vaccinated compared to unvaccinated women but, in the context of current vaccines, will remain an important prevention method. Comprehensive evaluation of new approaches to screening will need to consider the population-level effects of vaccination over time. New screening strategies of particular interest include delaying the start age of screening, increasing the screening interval and switching to primary {HPV} screening. Future evaluations of screening will also need to focus on the effects of disparities in screening and vaccination uptake, the potential effects of vaccination on screening participation, and the effects of imperfect compliance with screening recommendations.

	abstract = {Context: The sensitivity and specificity profile of measuring levels of prostate-specific antigen ({PSA}) to select men for prostate biopsy is not optimal. This has prompted the construction of nomograms and artificial neural networks ({ANNs}) to increase the performance of {PSA} measurements. Objective: A systematic review of nomograms and {ANNs} designed to predict the risk of a positive prostate biopsy for cancer was conducted in order to determine their value versus measuring {PSA} levels alone. Evidence acquisition: Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (U.S. National Library of Medicine's life science database; {MEDLINE}) was searched using the terms "nomogram" "artificial neural network" and "prostate cancer" for dates up to and including July 2007 and was supplemented by manual searches of reference lists. Included studies used an assessment tool to examine the risk of a positive prostate biopsy in a man without a known cancer diagnosis. Intramodel comparisons with evaluation of {PSA} levels alone, and intermodel comparisons of area under the curve ({AUC}) from receiver operating characteristic ({ROC}) curves were conducted. individual case examples were also used for comparisons. Evidence synthesis: Twenty-three studies examining 36 models were included. With the exception of two studies, all the models had {AUC} values of 0.70 or greater, with eight reporting an {AUC} of {\textgreater}= 0.80 and four (all {ANNs}) reporting an {AUC} {\textgreater}= 0.85, with variable validation status. Fourteen studies compared the {AUC} with {PSA} levels alone: all showed a benefit from using {AUCs} which varied from 0.02 to 0.26. Of the 16 external validation comparisons, in 13 the {AUC} was lower in the external population than in the model population. Conclusions: Nomograms and {ANNs} produce improvements in {AUC} over measurement of {PSA} levels alone, but many lack external validation. Where this is available, the benefits are often diminished, although most remain significantly better than with evaluation of {PSA} levels alone. In men without additional risk factors, {PSA} cutoff values alone provide a relatively precise risk estimate, but if additional risk factors are known, {PSA} values alone are less accurate.

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: To reduce the number of unnecessary biopsies in patients with benign prostatic disease, however, without missing significant {PCa} the present study re-evaluates the age-dependent {PSA} cut-offs in the Tyrol Prostate Cancer ({PCa}) early detection program.
{PATIENTS} {AND} {METHODS}: The study population included 2225 patients who underwent prostate biopsy due to elevated {PSA} levels at our department. We divided our patient collective into four age groups: ≤49 years (n = 178), 50-59 years (n = 597), 60-69 years (n = 962) and ≥70 years (n = 488). We simulated different scenarios for {PSA} cut-off values between 1.25 and 6 ng/{mL} and {fPSA}\% between 15 and 21\% for all four age groups and calculated sensitivity, specificity, confidence intervals and predictive values.
{RESULTS}: {PCa} was detected in 1218 men (54.7\%). We found that in combination with free {PSA} ≤21\% the following {PSA} cut-offs had the best cancer specificity: 1.75 ng/ml for men ≤49 years and 50-59 years, 2.25 ng/ml for men aged 60-69 years and 3.25 ng/ml for men ≥70 years. Using these adjusted {PSA} cut-off values all significant tumors are recognized in all age groups, yet the number of biopsies is reduced. Overall, one biopsy is avoided in 13 to 14 men (number needed to screen = 13.3, reduction of biopsies = 7.5\%) when decision regarding biopsy is done according to the "new" cut-off values instead of the "old" ones. For the different age groups the number needed to screen to avoid one biopsy varied between 9.2 (≤49 years) and 17.4 (50-59 years).
{CONCLUSION}: With "new", fine-tuned {PSA} cut-offs we detect all relevant {PCa} with a significant reduction of biopsies compared to the "old" cut-off values. Optimization of age-specific {PSA} cut-offs is one step towards a smarter strategy in the Tyrol {PCa} Early Detection Program.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVES}: Combination packages for {HIV} prevention can leverage the effectiveness of biomedical and behavioural elements to lower disease incidence with realistic targets for individual and population risk reduction. We investigated how sexual network structures can maximise the effectiveness of a package targeting sexually active adults in sub-Saharan Africa ({SSA}) with intervention components for medical male circumcision ({MMC}) and sexual partnership concurrency (having {\textgreater}1 ongoing partner).
{METHODS}: Network-based mathematical models of {HIV} type 1 ({HIV}-1) transmission dynamics among heterosexual couples were used to explore how changes to {MMC} alone and in combination with changes to concurrency impacted endemic {HIV}-1 prevalence and incidence. Starting from a base model parameterised from empirical data from West Africa, we simulated the prevalence of circumcision from 10\% to 90\% and concurrency was modelled at four discrete levels corresponding to values observed across {SSA}.
{RESULTS}: {MMC} and concurrency could contribute to the empirical variation in {HIV}-1 disease prevalence across {SSA}. Small reductions in concurrency resulted in large declines in {HIV}-1 prevalence. Scaling up circumcision in low-concurrency settings yields a greater relative benefit, but the absolute number of infections averted depends on both the circumcision coverage and baseline incidence. Epidemic extinction with this package will require substantial scale-up of {MMC} in low-concurrency settings.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Dynamic sexual network structure should be considered in the design and targeting of {MMC} within combination {HIV}-1 prevention packages. Realistic levels of coverage for these packages within southern Africa could lead to a reduction of incidence to the low levels observed in western Africa, and possibly, epidemic extinction.},

	abstract = {Chlamydia trachomatis is the most common bacterial sexually transmitted infection ({STI}) in many developed countries. The highest prevalence rates are found among young adults who have frequent partner change rates. Three published individual-based models have incorporated a detailed description of age-specific sexual behaviour in order to quantify the transmission of C. trachomatis in the population and to assess the impact of screening interventions. Owing to varying assumptions about sexual partnership formation and dissolution and the great uncertainty about critical parameters, such models show conflicting results about the impact of preventive interventions. Here, we perform a detailed evaluation of these models by comparing the partnership formation and dissolution dynamics with data from Natsal 2000, a population-based probability sample survey of sexual attitudes and lifestyles in Britain. The data also allow us to describe the dispersion of C. trachomatis infections as a function of sexual behaviour, using the Gini coefficient. We suggest that the Gini coefficient is a useful measure for calibrating infectious disease models that include risk structure and highlight the need to estimate this measure for other {STIs}.},

	abstract = {Decision-analytic models must often be informed using data that are only indirectly related to the main model parameters. The authors outline how to implement a Bayesian synthesis of diverse sources of evidence to calibrate the parameters of a complex model. A graphical model is built to represent how observed data are generated from statistical models with unknown parameters and how those parameters are related to quantities of interest for decision making. This forms the basis of an algorithm to estimate a posterior probability distribution, which represents the updated state of evidence for all unknowns given all data and prior beliefs. This process calibrates the quantities of interest against data and, at the same time, propagates all parameter uncertainties to the results used for decision making. To illustrate these methods, the authors demonstrate how a previously developed Markov model for the progression of human papillomavirus ({HPV}-16) infection was rebuilt in a Bayesian framework. Transition probabilities between states of disease severity are inferred indirectly from cross-sectional observations of prevalence of {HPV}-16 and {HPV}-16-related disease by age, cervical cancer incidence, and other published information. Previously, a discrete collection of plausible scenarios was identified but with no further indication of which of these are more plausible. Instead, the authors derive a Bayesian posterior distribution, in which scenarios are implicitly weighted according to how well they are supported by the data. In particular, we emphasize the appropriate choice of prior distributions and checking and comparison of fitted models.},

A total of 4955 men were enrolled into the study. Serum {tPSA}, {fPSA}, and f/t {PSA} ratios were determined for the study population. All males who had suspicious digital rectal examination and {tPSA} {\textgreater} 4 ng/{mL} underwent transrectal ultrasonography-guided prostate biopsy. Receiver operating characteristic ({ROC}) curves for each group were generated by plotting the sensitivity versus 1-specificity for the f/t {PSA} ratio. The sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio ({PLR}), and negative likelihood ratio ({NLR}) were obtained using various f/t {PSA} ratio cutoffs for different age groups. There were 657 patients with a {PSA} level of 4-10 ng/{mL}. According to sensitivity and specificity f/t\% {PSA} cutoff points were determined to be 10\%, 15\%, 15\%, and 10\% in 50-59 years, 60-69 years, {\textgreater} 70 years, and all ages categories, respectively, in patients with initial {PSA} level of 4-10 ng/{mL}. f/t {PSA} ratio had an area under the curve ({AUC}) value of 0.81 (95\% confidence level: 0.80-0.82) for all age groups in detecting prostate cancer. f/t {PSA} ratio has an {AUC} value of 0.669 (0.632-0.705) in detecting prostate cancer among patients with a {PSA} level of 4-10 ng/{mL}. Ten percent of f/t {PSA} ratio had the highest specificity with {PLR} and 30\% f/t {PSA} ratio had the highest sensitivity with lower {NLR} in the all-age categories. The current study shows that the use of f/t {PSA} ratio in patients with {PSA} levels of 4 -10 ng/{mL} should enhance the specificity of {PSA} screening and decrease the number of unnecessary biopsies. The age-related changes warrant further investigation in a large, multicentric, and multinational population to improve the clinical use of f/t {PSA} cutoffs.

	abstract = {Background: Sex-specific differences regarding the transmissibility and the course of infection are the rule rather than the exception in the epidemiology of sexually transmitted infections ({STIs}). Human papillomavirus ({HPV}) provides an example: disease outcomes differ between men and women, as does the potential for transmission to the opposite sex. {HPV} vaccination of preadolescent girls was recently introduced in many countries, and inclusion of boys in the vaccination programs is being discussed. Here, we address the question of whether vaccinating females only, males only, or both sexes is the most effective strategy to reduce the population prevalence of an {STI} like {HPV}. Methods and Findings: We use a range of two-sex transmission models with varying detail to identify general criteria for allocating a prophylactic vaccine between both sexes. The most effective reduction in the population prevalence of infection is always achieved by single-sex vaccination; vaccinating the sex with the highest prevaccine prevalence is the preferred strategy in most circumstances. Exceptions arise only when the higher prevaccine prevalence is due to a substantially lower rate of natural immunity, or when natural immunity is lifelong, and a prolonged duration of infectiousness coincides with increased transmissibility. Predictions from simple models were confirmed in simulations based on an elaborate {HPV} transmission model. Our analysis suggests that relatively inefficient genital transmission from males to females might render male vaccination more effective in reducing overall infection levels. However, most existing {HPV} vaccination programs have achieved sufficient coverage to continue with female-only vaccination. Conclusions: Increasing vaccine uptake among preadolescent girls is more effective in reducing {HPV} infection than including boys in existing vaccination programs. As a rule, directing prophylactic immunization at the sex with the highest prevaccine prevalence results in the largest reduction of the population prevalence.},

The model extends previous work in this area by the representation of patterns of mixing between and within different age and sexual activity classes in a two sex structure. Summary parameters are derived to represent different mixing patterns, ranging from assortative via random to disassortative, as are methods to ensure that particular mixing patterns between different age and sexual classes (stratified on the basis of rates of sexual partner change) meet constraints that balance the supply and demand for sexual partners as {AIDS} induced mortality influences the demographic structure of a population. Analyses of model behaviour rely on numerical methods due to the complexity of the mathematical framework, and sensitivity analyses are conducted to assess the significance of different assumptions and different parameter assignments. Simulated patterns of {HIV} spread across the two sexes and various age classes are compared with observed patterns in Uganda. The principle conclusion of the study is that the pattern of mixing between age and sexual activity classes, combined with the assumptions made to balance supply and demand between the sexes have a very major influence on the predicted pattern of {HIV} spread and the demographic impact of {AIDS}.

	abstract = {Microsimulation models that describe disease processes synthesize information from multiple sources and can be used to estimate the effects of screening and treatment on cancer incidence and mortality at a population level. These models are characterized by simulation of individual event histories for an idealized population of interest. Microsimulation models are complex and invariably include parameters that are not well informed by existing data. Therefore, a key component of model development is the choice of parameter values. Microsimulation model parameter values are selected to reproduce expected or known results though the process of model calibration. Calibration may be done by perturbing model parameters one at a time or by using a search algorithm. As an alternative, we propose a Bayesian method to calibrate microsimulation models that uses Markov chain Monte Carlo. We show that this approach converges to the target distribution and use a simulation study to demonstrate its finite-sample performance. Although computationally intensive, this approach has several advantages over previously proposed methods, including the use of statistical criteria to select parameter values, simultaneous calibration of multiple parameters to multiple data sources, incorporation of information via prior distributions, description of parameter identifiability, and the ability to obtain interval estimates of model parameters. We develop a microsimulation model for colorectal cancer and use our proposed method to calibrate model parameters. The microsimulation model provides a good fit to the calibration data. We find evidence that some parameters are identified primarily through prior distributions. Our results underscore the need to incorporate multiple sources of variability (i.e., due to calibration data, unknown parameters, and estimated parameters and predicted values) when calibrating and applying microsimulation models.},

	abstract = {Objective: Both the duration of sexual partnerships and the time between two consecutive partnerships (gap length) varies between populations. We use a mathematical model with multiple partnership durations and gap lengths to identify the types of relationship cycles that sustain gonorrhea transmission in the United Kingdom. Study Design: A mathematical model for gonorrhea transmission was constructed which tracks the duration of partnerships and their preceding gap lengths. The National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles was used to parameterize the model population into 5 different partnership lengths (mean of 1 day, 2 weeks, 8 weeks, 30 weeks, and 10 years) and 3 preceding gap lengths (14 days, 8 weeks, and 1.5 years). Results: The model was able to reproduce patterns of gonococcal infection in the United Kingdom. Assortative (like-with-like) mixing of individuals with short gaps between partnerships was required for gonorrhea infection to persist. Prevalence was highest in individuals with short ({\textgreater}1 day-{\textless}1 month) and midterm partnership durations ({\textgreater}1 month-{\textless}3 months). Interventions (such as increased condom use) targeted at those with medium-term partnerships were most effective at reducing prevalence; in contrast targeting interventions at those with short partnerships but longer gap lengths (i.e., the group with the highest number of sexual partners) had relatively less impact. Conclusion: Our model suggests that gonorrhea is sustained by the presence of a small group of individuals with short gap lengths and medium length partnerships. Interventions targeted at this group are more effective than those targeted at individuals with high numbers of sexual partners but longer gap lengths.},

We examined several scenarios (from continuation of the current status quo to perfect achievement of targets) with differing combinations of male condom use, adult male circumcision, {HIV} testing, and early antiretroviral therapy ({ART}). We varied numerous parameters, including the proportion of adult males circumcised, the frequency of condom use during sex acts, acceptance of {HIV} testing, linkage to health care, criteria for {ART} initiation, {ART} viral suppression rates, and loss to follow-up. Maintaining current levels of combination prevention would lead to increasing {HIV} incidence and prevalence in South Africa, while the perfect combination scenario was projected to eliminate {HIV} on a 50-year time scale from 2013 to 2063. Perfecting testing and treatment, without changing condom use or circumcision rates, resulted in an 89\% reduction in {HIV} incidence but not elimination. Universal adult male circumcision alone resulted in a 21\% incidence reduction within 20 years. Substantial decreases in {HIV} incidence are possible from sufficient uptake of both primary prevention and {ART}, but with continuation of the status quo, {HIV} elimination in South Africa is unlikely within a 50-year time scale.},

	abstract = {Background: The quadrivalent and bivalent human papillomavirus ({HPV}) vaccines are now licensed in several countries. We compared the cost-effectiveness of the {HPV} vaccines to provide evidence for policy decisions. Methods: We developed {HPV}-{ADVISE}, a multi-type individual-based transmission-dynamic model of {HPV} infection and disease (anogenital warts, and cervical, anogenital and oropharyngeal cancers). We calibrated the model to sexual behavior and epidemiologic data from Canada, and estimated quality-adjusted life-years ({QALYs}) lost and costs (\${CAN} 2010) from the literature. Vaccine-type efficacy was based on a systematic literature review. The analysis was performed from the healthcare provider perspective, and costs and benefits were discounted at 3\%. Predictions are presented using the median [10th;90th percentiles] of simulations. Results: Under base-case assumptions (vaccinating 10-year-old girls, 80\% coverage, \$95/dose), using the quadrivalent and bivalent vaccines is estimated to cost \$15,528 [12,056;19,140] and \$20,182 [15,531;25,240] per {QALY}-gained, respectively. At equal price, the quadrivalent vaccine is more cost-effective than bivalent under all scenarios investigated, except when assuming longer duration of protection for the bivalent and minimal anogenital warts burden. Under base-case assumptions, the maximum additional cost per dose for the quadrivalent vaccine to remain more cost-effective than the bivalent is \$32 [17;46] (using a \$40,000/{QALY}-gained threshold). Results were most sensitive to discounting, time-horizon, differences in durations of protection and anogenital warts burden. Conclusions: Vaccinating pre-adolescent girls against {HPV} is predicted to be highly cost-effective. If equally priced, the quadrivalent is the most economically desirable vaccine. However, ultimately, the most cost-effective {HPV} vaccine will be determined by their relative price. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Both are correlated with each other and are also affected by measurement errors and tumor attributes such as regional lymph node spread. We propose a general stochastic approach to calibrate the survival benefit of screen-detected cancers related to both biases, measurement errors, and tumor attributes. We apply our proposed method to breast cancer screening data from one arm of the Swedish Two-County trial in the trial period together with the subsequent service screening for the same cohort. When there is no calibration, the results assuming a constant (exponentially distributed) post-lead-time hazard rate (i.e., a homogeneous stochastic process)-show a 57\% reduction in breast cancer death over 25 years. After correction, the reduction was 30\%, with approximately 12\% of the overestimation being due to lead-time bias and 15\% due to length bias. The additional impacts of measurement errors (sensitivity and specificity) depend on the type of the proposed model and follow-up time. The corresponding analysis when the Weibull distribution was applied-relaxing the assumption of a constant hazard rate-yielded similar findings and lacked statistical significance compared with the exponential model. The proposed calibration approach allows the benefit of a service cancer screening program to be fairly evaluated. This article has supplementary materials online.},

	abstract = {Infection with human papillomavirus ({HPV}) is the primary cause of cervical cancer, other anogenital cancers, genital warts, and recurrent respiratory papillomatosis. Clinical studies have demonstrated that a prophylactic {HPV} vaccine can prevent infection, genital warts, and the precancerous lesions that lead to cervical cancer. Given the absence of data on the long-term effectiveness of {HPV} vaccination, a number of mathematical models have been developed to provide insight to policy makers by projecting the long-term epidemiologic and economic consequences of vaccination and evaluate alternative vaccination policies. This paper reviews the state of these models. Three types of {HPV} mathematical models have been reported in the literature: cohort, population dynamic, and hybrid. All have demonstrated that vaccination can significantly reduce the incidence of cervical cancer in the long term. However, only the cohort and hybrid models have evaluated the cost-effectiveness of vaccination strategies for preventing cervical cancer. These models have generally shown that vaccinating females can be cost-effective. None has accounted for the potential benefits of vaccinating the population to reduce the burden of recurrent respiratory papillomatosis and cancers of the vagina, vulva, anus, penis, and head/neck. Given that only the population dynamic model can account for both the direct and indirect (i.e., herd immunity effects) benefits of vaccination in the population, future research should focus on further development of dynamic models by expanding the range of epidemiologic outcomes tracked and including the ability to assess the cost-effectiveness of alternative vaccination policies.},

	abstract = {Background Although there is uncertainty about the effect of prostate-specific antigen ({PSA}) screening on the rate of prostate cancer death, there is little uncertainty about its effect on the rate of prostate cancer diagnosis. Systematic estimates of the number of men affected, however, to our knowledge, do not exist.
Methods We obtained data on age-specific incidence and initial course of therapy from the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program. We then used age-specific male population estimates from the {US} Census to determine the excess (or deficit) in the number of men diagnosed and treated in each year after 1986—the year before {PSA} screening was introduced.
Results Overall incidence of prostate cancer rose rapidly after 1986, peaked in 1992, and then declined, albeit to levels considerably higher than those in 1986. Overall incidence, however, obscured distinct age-specific patterns: The relative incidence rate (2005 relative to 1986) was 0.56 in men aged 80 years and older, 1.09 in men aged 70–79 years, 1.91 in men aged 60–69 years, 3.64 in men aged 50–59 years, and 7.23 in men younger than 50 years. Since 1986, an estimated additional 1 305 600 men were diagnosed with prostate cancer, 1 004 800 of whom were definitively treated for the disease. Using the most optimistic assumption about the benefit of screening—that the entire decline in prostate cancer mortality observed during this period is attributable to this additional diagnosis—we estimated that, for each man who experienced the presumed benefit, more than 20 had to be diagnosed with prostate cancer.
Conclusions The introduction of {PSA} screening has resulted in more than 1 million additional men being diagnosed and treated for prostate cancer in the United States. The growth is particularly dramatic for younger men. Given the considerable time that has passed since {PSA} screening began, most of this excess incidence must represent overdiagnosis.},

We aimed to develop a method to evaluate evidence for changes in risk behaviour altering the course of an {HIV} epidemic. Methods: We developed a mathematical model of {HIV} transmission, incorporating the potential for natural changes in the epidemic as it matures and the introduction of antiretroviral treatment, and applied a Bayesian Melding framework, in which the model and observed trends in prevalence can be compared. We applied the model to Zimbabwe, using {HIV} prevalence estimates from antenatal clinic surveillance and house-hold based surveys, and basing model parameters on data from sexual behaviour surveys. Results: There was strong evidence for reductions in risk behaviour stemming {HIV} transmission. We estimate these changes occurred between 1999 and 2004 and averted 660,000 (95\% credible interval: 460,000-860,000) infections by 2008. Discussion: The model and associated analysis framework provide a robust way to evaluate the evidence for changes in risk behaviour affecting the course of {HIV} epidemics, avoiding confounding by the natural evolution of {HIV} epidemics.

This article identifies features of overdiagnosis studies that influence results and shows their effect by using published research. First, different ways to define and measure overdiagnosis are considered. Second, contextual features and how they affect overdiagnosis estimates are examined. Third, the effect of estimation approach is discussed. Many studies use excess incidence under screening as a proxy for overdiagnosis. Others use statistical models to make inferences about lead time or natural history and then derive the corresponding fraction of cases that are overdiagnosed.

A standard approach consists in minimizing an objective function which includes a quadratic (squared l(2)) error term combined with a sparseness-inducing (l(1)) regularization term. Basis pursuit, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator ({LASSO}), wavelet-based deconvolution, and compressed sensing are a few well-known examples of this approach. This paper proposes gradient projection ({GP}) algorithms for the bound-constrained quadratic programming ({BCQP}) formulation of these problems. We test variants of this approach that select the line search parameters in different ways, including techniques based on the Barzilai-Borwein method. Computational experiments show that these {GP} approaches perform well in a wide range of applications, often being significantly faster (in terms of computation time) than competing methods. Although the performance of {GP} methods tends to degrade as the regularization term is de-emphasized, we show how they can be embedded in a continuation scheme to recover their efficient practical performance.},

Repurposing the data provides an unparalleled resource for matching patients with the outcomes of demographically or diagnostically comparable patients. A web-based application was developed to query this subset of patient information against a given patient's demographics and risk factors. Analysis of the matched data yields outcome information which can then be used to guide management decisions and imaging software. Prognostic information is also estimated via the proportion of matched patients that progress to cancer. The {US} Preventative Services Task Force provides screening recommendations for cancers of the breast, colorectal tract, and lungs. There is wide variability in adherence of clinicians to these guidelines and others published by the Fleischner Society and various cancer organizations. Data mining the {PLCO} dataset for clinical decision support can optimize the use of limited healthcare resources, focusing screening on patients for whom the benefit to risk ratio is the greatest and most efficacious. A data driven, personalized approach to cancer screening maximizes the economic and clinical efficacy and enables early identification of patients in which the course of disease can be improved.

	abstract = {Background: The objectives of this study were to determine whether a single result for total prostate-specific antigen ({tPSA}) can be used confidently to guide the need for prostate biopsy and by how much serial {tPSA} measurements must differ to be significant. {tPSA} measurements include both analytical and biological components of variation. The European Group on Tumor Markers conducted a literature survey to determine both the magnitude and impact of biological variation on single, the mean of replicate, and serial {tPSA} measurements. Methods: The survey yielded 27 studies addressing the topic, and estimates for the biological variation of {tPSA} could be derived from 12 of these studies. Results: The mean biological variation was 20\% in the concentration range 0.1-20 mu g/L for men over 50 years. The biological variation means that the one-sided 95\% confidence interval ({CI}) of the dispersion for a single {tPSA} result is similar to 33\%. Three replicate samples with one analysis on each narrow the one-sided 95\% {CI} for the mean concentration to similar to 20\% and facilitate decisions on prostate biopsy. During monitoring of serial measurements, the change needed for significance is similar to 50\% (P {\textless} 0.05). Conclusions: The biological variation of {tPSA} has implications for screening, diagnosis, and monitoring. Single measurements may not be sufficiently precise for screening and diagnosis. Replicate samples and calculation of the mean concentration may improve precision by reducing the dispersion. Monitoring of {tPSA} requires an estimate of either the change needed for significance or, alternatively, of the significance of the change. (c) 2005 American Association for Clinical Chemistry.},

We provide a computationally efficient method for determining a cost-effective dynamic intervention strategy that takes into account (i) the results of the previous test for each individual and (ii) the change in the individual's behavior based on awareness of the disease. We demonstrate the usefulness of the approach by applying the results to screening decisions for Hepatitis C ({HCV}) using medical data, and compare our findings to current {HCV} screening recommendations.

In the absence of controlled trials or prospectively designed studies, dynamic mathematical models that incorporate movements in and out of jail and sexual contacts (including disease transmission) can provide useful information. We explored the impact of jail-based chlamydia screening on a hypothetical community's prevalence with a deterministic compartmental model focusing on heterosexual transmission. Parameter values were obtained from the published literature. Two analyses were conducted. One used national values (large community); the other used values reported among African Americans-the population with the highest incarceration rates and chlamydia burden (small community). A comprehensive sensitivity analysis was carried out. For the large-community analysis, chlamydia prevalence decreased by 13\% (from 2.3\% to 2.0\%), and based on the ranges of parameter values (including screening coverage of 10\%-100\% and a post-screening treatment rate of 50\%-100\%) used in the sensitivity analysis, this decrease ranged from 0.1\% to 58\%. For the small-community analysis, chlamydia prevalence decreased by 54\% (from 4.6\% to 2.1\%). Jail-based chlamydia screen-and-treat programs have the potential to reduce chlamydia prevalence in communities with high incarceration rates. However, the magnitude of this potential decrease is subject to considerable uncertainty.},

	abstract = {Background. Baseline information on human papillomavirus ({HPV}) prevalence and type distribution is highly desirable to evaluate the impact of prophylactic {HPV} vaccines in the near future. Methods. A meta-analysis was performed of studies published between 1995 and 2009 that used polymerase chain reaction or Hybrid Capture 2 for {HPV} detection in women with normal cytological findings. Results. The analysis included 194 studies comprising 1,016,719 women with normal cytological findings. The estimated global {HPV} prevalence was 11.7\% (95\% confidence interval, 11.6\%-11.7\%). Sub-Saharan Africa (24.0\%), Eastern Europe (21.4\%), and Latin America (16.1\%) showed the highest prevalences. Age-specific {HPV} distribution presented with a first peak at younger ages ({\textless}25 years) and, in the Americas and Africa, a rebound at older ages ({\textgreater}= 45 years). Among the women with type-specific {HPV} data (n=215,568), the 5 most common types worldwide were {HPV}-16 (3.2\%), {HPV}-18 (1.4\%), {HPV}-52 (0.9\%), {HPV}-31 (0.8\%), and {HPV}-58 (0.7\%). Conclusions. Although the prevalence of {HPV} in women with normal cytological findings is high and variable across world regions, {HPV} types 16, 18, 31, 52, and 58 are consistently found among the 10 most common types in all of them.

	abstract = {Background Epidemiological data show substantial variation in the risk of {HIV} infection between communities within African countries. We hypothesised that focusing appropriate interventions on geographies and key populations at high risk of {HIV} infection could improve the effect of investments in the {HIV} response. Methods With use of Kenya as a case study, we developed a mathematical model that described the spatiotemporal evolution of the {HIV} epidemic and that incorporated the demographic, behavioural, and programmatic differences across subnational units. Modelled interventions (male circumcision, behaviour change communication, early antiretoviral therapy, and pre-exposure prophylaxis) could be provided to different population groups according to their risk behaviours or their location. For a given national budget, we compared the effect of a uniform intervention strategy, in which the same complement of interventions is provided across the country, with a focused strategy that tailors the set of interventions and amount of resources allocated to the local epidemiological conditions. Findings A uniformly distributed combination of {HIV} prevention interventions could reduce the total number of new {HIV} infections by 40\% during a 15-year period. With no additional spending, this effect could be increased by 14\% during the 15 years-almost 100 000 extra infections, and result in 33\% fewer new {HIV} infections occurring every year by the end of the period if the focused approach is used to tailor resource allocation to reflect patterns in local epidemiology. The cumulative difference in new infections during the 15-year projection period depends on total budget and costs of interventions, and could be as great as 150 000 (a cumulative difference as great as 22\%) under different assumptions about the unit costs of intervention. Interpretation The focused approach achieves greater effect than the uniform approach despite exactly the same investment. Through prioritisation of the people and locations at greatest risk of infection, and adaption of the interventions to reflect the local epidemiological context, the focused approach could substantially increase the efficiency and effectiveness of investments in {HIV} prevention.},

	abstract = {The patterns of transmission, clearance, and progression of {HPV} infection and the related precancerous lesions are key to accurately model cervical cancer epidemiology and prevention. We have developed an age-structured dynamic model of the transmission of {HPV}-16 infection. This mathematical model accounts, for the first time, for the effect of infection and precancerous lesions duration on the natural history of {HPV}-16 infection and precancerous lesions. The model's output has been fitted to contemporaneous sets of data from Turin, Italy, to estimate parameters that have had been indirectly tested by comparing them with other estimates reported in the literature. The average probability of {HPV}-16 infection transmission per sexual partnership was about 40\%. The {HPV}-16 clearance and progression rates decreased as the length of time with infection increased, clearance ranging between 1.6 per woman-year (in the first 6 months of infection) and 0.036 (after more than 6 years of infection), and progression between 0.072 and 0.018 per woman-year. The rate of clearance of precancerous lesions ({CIN}2+) was inversely dependent on age, while the progression of {CIN}2+ toward invasive cervical cancer increased as the precancerous lesions persisted. The present study also suggests that an exclusive role of women's age in shaping the rate of progression to cancer is unlikely. These results should inform future analyses. Including more accurately the role of the duration of infection and precancerous lesions as determinants of the cervical cancer occurrence in models of cervical cancer control may influence predictors of the effectiveness of intervention strategies.

The reduced transmission of vaccine-type {HPV} from vaccination of girls was assumed to lower the risk of {HPV} associated cancer in all men but not to affect the excess risk of {HPV} associated cancers among men who have sex with men. {SETTING} General population in the Netherlands. {INTERVENTION} Inclusion of boys aged 12 into {HPV} vaccination programmes. {MAIN} {OUTCOME} {MEASURES} Quality adjusted life years ({QALYs}) and numbers needed to vaccinate. {RESULTS} Before {HPV} vaccination, 14.9 (95\% credible interval 12.2 to 18.1) {QALYs} per thousand men were lost to vaccine preventable cancers associated with {HPV} in the Netherlands. This burden would be reduced by 37\% (28\% to 48\%) if the vaccine uptake among girls remains at the current level of 60\%. To prevent one additional case of cancer among men, 795 boys (660 to 987) would need to be vaccinated; with tumour specific numbers for anal, penile, and oropharyngeal cancer of 2162, 3486, and 1975, respectively. The burden of {HPV} related cancer in men would be reduced by 66\% (53\% to 805) if vaccine uptake among girls increases to 90\%. In that case, 1735 boys (1240 to 2900) would need to be vaccinated to prevent an additional case; with tumour specific numbers for anal, penile, and oropharyngeal cancer of 2593, 29107, and 6484, respectively. {CONCLUSIONS} Men will benefit indirectly from vaccination of girls but remain at risk of cancers associated with {HPV}. The incremental benefit of vaccinating boys when vaccine uptake among girls is high is driven by the prevention of anal carcinomas, which underscores the relevance of {HPV} prevention efforts for men who have sex with men.},

We evaluated the benefit of screening mammography in reducing breast cancer mortality using observational data from the {SEER}-Medicare linked database.

Censored information for the bivariate response vector (T(0), T(1)) was observed and used to generate a likelihood function. However, the contribution to the likelihood function for some observations could not be calculated analytically, thus, censoring boundaries for these observations were modified. Inferences about the impact of screening mammography on breast cancer mortality were made on maximum likelihood estimates derived from this likelihood function. Hazard rations (95\% confidence intervals) of 0.54 (0.48-0.61) and 0.33 (0.26-0.42) for single and regular users (vs. non-users), respectively, demonstrated a protective effect of screening mammography among women 69 years and older.

Data on infection prevalence, participation rates, and sexual behavior were obtained from a large pilot study conducted in The Netherlands. Opposite to almost all previous economic evaluations of {CT} screening, we developed a dynamic Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible ({SIS}) model to estimate the impact of the screening program on the incidence and prevalence of {CT} in the population. {SIS} models are widely used in epidemiology of infectious diseases, for modeling the transmission dynamics over time. Subsequently, a predictive decision model was used to calculate the complications averted by the screening program. Cost-effectiveness was expressed as the net costs per major outcome averted ({MOA}) and was estimated in the baseline analysis and in sensitivity analysis. The overall prevalence decreased from 1.79\% to 1.05\% as a result of the screening program directed at both men and women. The program costs were mainly offset by the averted costs, although not fully. Resulting net costs per {MOA} were 373 in the baseline analysis. Sensitivity analysis showed that partner treatment and sending a reminder are important aspects improving cost-effectiveness. Additionally, restricting the screening to women only was estimated to save costs. Our cost-effectiveness analysis shows that the Dutch society has net to pay for the prevention of {CT}-complications through screening young men and women. One could argue although that 373 per {MOA} presents a reasonable cost. A screening program consisting of screening women only should always be adopted from a pharmacoeconomic point of view. Our dynamic approach appreciates better the specific characteristics of an infectious disease, such as {CT}.},

Use of discrete-time steps can introduce errors when calculating cumulative outcomes such as costs and quality-adjusted life-years. There are a number of myths or misconceptions concerning how to correct these errors and the need to do so. This tutorial shows that, by neglecting to apply within-cycle (sometimes referred to as half-cycle or continuity) correction methods to the results of discrete-time models, the analyst may arrive at the wrong recommendation regarding the use of a technology. We show that the standard half-cycle correction method results in the same cumulative outcome as the trapezoidal rule and life-table method. However, the trapezoidal rule has the added advantage of applying the correction at each cycle, not just the initial and final cycle. We further show that the Simpson's 1/3 rule is more accurate than the trapezoidal rule. We recommend using the Simpson's 1/3 rule in the base-case analysis and, if needed, showing the results with other methods in the sensitivity analysis. We also demonstrate that both the trapezoidal and Simpson's rules can easily be implemented in commonly used software.},

Such decisions are increasingly being made with significant input from mathematical and economic models. The demand for modeling has resulted in the publication of numerous mathematical models looking at the cost-effectiveness of {HPV} vaccination. Objective: To review published models that have been used to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of {HPV} vaccination in developed countries and highlight points of consensus and disagreement in methods and findings. Methods: This review consists of cost-effectiveness studies published in the peer-reviewed literature before August 2008. Results: Despite variations in methods, modeling studies are producing consistent conclusions: (1) vaccinating young girls against {HPV} is likely to be cost-effective; (2) vaccinating boys will most likely not be cost-effective in countries that can reach high coverage rates in girls, and (3) results are most sensitive to the duration of vaccine protection. However, results from analyses examining the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of vaccinating boys when coverage rates are low ({\textless}= 80\%) and catch-up strategies have reached conflicting conclusions.

	abstract = {In a previous study we noticed that there might be co-infections of {HBV} and {HIV} by comparing incidence rates of these two diseases in China. The comparisons between the incidence data of {HBV} and sexually transmitted diseases (including {AIDS}, {HIV}, syphilis and gonorrhea) in China demonstrate that sexual transmission is an important route of spread of {HBV} in China. On the basis of this fact, in this paper we propose a compartmental model including under-aged children, male adults, and female adults. The effect of sexual transmission on the spread and prevalence of {HBV} in China is studied. The model is employed to simulate the {HBV} incidence data reported by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention for under-aged children, adult males, and adult females, respectively. The sensitivity analysis of the basic reproduction number indicates that it is important and crucial to increase the immunization rate for both under-aged children and adults in order to control the transmission of {HBV} in China. Our study suggests that effective control measures for hepatitis B in China include enhancing public education and awareness about hepatitis B virus, particularly about the fact that hepatitis B is a sexually transmitted disease, and increasing the immunization rate for both under-aged children and adults, especially for those groups of high risk.

	abstract = {Background: Standard approaches to estimation of Markov models with data from randomized controlled trials tend either to make a judgment about which transition(s) treatments act on, or they assume that treatment has a separate effect on every transition. An alternative is to fit a series of models that assume that treatment acts on specific transitions. Investigators can then choose among alternative models using goodness-of-fit statistics. However, structural uncertainty about any chosen parameterization will remain and this may have implications for the resulting decision and the need for further research. Methods: We describe a Bayesian approach to model estimation, and model selection. Structural uncertainty about which parameterization to use is accounted for using model averaging and we developed a formula for calculating the expected value of perfect information ({EVPI}) in averaged models. Marginal posterior distributions are generated for each of the cost-effectiveness parameters using Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation in {WinBUGS}, or Monte-Carlo simulation in Excel (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, {WA}). We illustrate the approach with an example of treatments for asthma using aggregate-level data from a connected network of four treatments compared in three pair-wise randomized controlled trials. Results: The standard errors of incremental net benefit using structured models is reduced by up to eight-or ninefold compared to the unstructured models, and the expected loss attaching to decision uncertainty by factors of several hundreds. Model averaging had considerable influence on the {EVPI}. Conclusions: Alternative structural assumptions can alter the treatment decision and have an overwhelming effect on model uncertainty and expected value of information. Structural uncertainty can be accounted for by model averaging, and the {EVPI} can be calculated for averaged models.

We describe the two prerequisites for cancer overdiagnosis to occur: the existence of a silent disease reservoir and activities leading to its detection (particularly cancer screening). We estimated the magnitude of overdiagnosis from randomized trials: about 25\% of mammographically detected breast cancers, 50\% of chest x-ray and/or sputum-detected lung cancers, and 60\% of prostate-specific antigen–detected prostate cancers. We also review data from observational studies and population-based cancer statistics suggesting overdiagnosis in computed tomography–detected lung cancer, neuroblastoma, thyroid cancer, melanoma, and kidney cancer. To address the problem, patients must be adequately informed of the nature and the magnitude of the trade-off involved with early cancer detection. Equally important, researchers need to work to develop better estimates of the magnitude of overdiagnosis and develop clinical strategies to help minimize it.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.annepidem.2006.10.011},
	abstract = {Purpose
Several mathematical models simulate a {HIV}/{AIDS} epidemic by using the assumption that heterosexual transmission is the major or sole transmission mode. The validity of these models has been unclear. To understand the validity of these models, empirical estimates for relevant model parameters are needed that can be compared with parameters used in mathematical models.
Methods
A brief review of per-contact transmission probabilities based on {HIV}-discordant, monogamous couples is provided, and sources of bias in transmission efficiency estimates are discussed. Average number of partnerships and the distribution of partnerships are estimated for seven sub-Saharan African countries. Distribution parameters are fitted to the Poisson distribution, negative binomial distribution, and the discrete Pareto (Zipf) distribution, using the maximum likelihood method. The Pearson χ2 test statistic is used to measure goodness of fit, and the Akaike and Bayesian information criteria are also provided. To balance the reported number of partnerships, missing number of prostitutes is estimated. These empirical estimates for relevant model parameters are compared with parameters used in representative models of nominal heterosexual {HIV} transmission in Africa.
Results
Reported transmission efficiencies (unadjusted for competing exposures that inflate estimates) per sexual episode range from 0.0003 to 0.0012. Average number of partnerships is less than 1.5 in all countries. The discrete Pareto distribution fits the data better than the Poisson or negative binominal distribution. In almost all countries, female reported number of partners follows a discrete Pareto distribution. To close the sex disparity gap in number of partnerships, between 0.13\% and 0.69\% of the female population would need to be classified as prostitutes. Comparing these estimates with the parameter values used in existing mathematical models shows that existing models use grossly inflated per contact transmission efficiencies or rely on implausible assumptions regarding contact frequency, which results in implausibly high per-partner transmission rates. Assumptions regarding average number of partners are too high, and the distribution of partnerships is not supported by available data. As a consequence, existing mathematical models overestimate nominally heterosexually transmitted {HIV} infection in sub-Saharan Africa.
Conclusions
Existing models of nominal heterosexual {HIV} transmission for sub-Saharan Africa rely on assumptions inconsistent with empirical evidence. Simulations have not accurately portrayed the epidemiological situation in sub-Saharan Africa, and conclusions drawn from these models should be interpreted with great caution. To realistically simulate {HIV} spread in sub-Saharan Africa's general population nominally due to heterosexual {HIV} transmission, parameter values should be based on the most accurate data.},

	abstract = {Background After 11 years of follow-up, the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer ({ERSPC}) reported a 29\% reduction in prostate-cancer mortality among men who underwent screening for prostate-specific antigen ({PSA}) levels. However, the extent to which harms to quality of life resulting from overdiagnosis and treatment counterbalance this benefit is uncertain. Methods On the basis of {ERSPC} follow-up data, we used Microsimulation Screening Analysis ({MISCAN}) to predict the number of prostate cancers, treatments, deaths, and quality-adjusted life-years ({QALYs}) gained after the introduction of {PSA} screening. Various screening strategies, efficacies, and quality-of-life assumptions were modeled. Results Per 1000 men of all ages who were followed for their entire life span, we predicted that annual screening of men between the ages of 55 and 69 years would result in nine fewer deaths from prostate cancer (28\% reduction), 14 fewer men receiving palliative therapy (35\% reduction), and a total of 73 life-years gained (average, 8.4 years per prostate-cancer death avoided). The number of {QALYs} that were gained was 56 (range, -21 to 97), a reduction of 23\% from unadjusted life-years gained. To prevent one prostate-cancer death, 98 men would need to be screened and 5 cancers would need to be detected. Screening of all men between the ages of 55 and 74 would result in more life-years gained (82) but the same number of {QALYs} (56). Conclusions The benefit of {PSA} screening was diminished by loss of {QALYs} owing to postdiagnosis long-term effects. Longer follow-up data from both the {ERSPC} and quality-of-life analyses are essential before universal recommendations regarding screening can be made.

Assuming 70\% coverage, {HPV} 16, 18 vaccination of adolescent girls is expected to reduce the lifetime risk of cancer by approximately 42.7\% (range, 33.2-53.5\%); screening three times per lifetime is expected to reduce risk by 21.9-30.7\% depending on the screening test, and a combined approach of vaccination and screening is expected to reduce cancer risk by a mean of 60.8\% (range, 52.8-70.1\%). In Brazil; provided the cost per vaccinated woman is less than I\$ 25, implying a per dose cost of approximately 1\$ 5, vaccination before age 12, followed by screening three times per lifetime between ages 35 and 45, would be considered very cost-effective using the country's per capita gross domestic product as a cost-effectiveness threshold. Assuming a coverage rate of 70\%, this strategy would be expected to prevent approximately 100,000 cases of invasive cervical cancer over a 5-year period. Vaccination strategies identified as cost-effective may be unaffordable in countries with similar socioeconomic profiles as Brazil without assistance; these results can provide guidance to the global community by identifying health investments of highest priority and with the greatest promise.

At each visit, interview information was obtained and a cervicovaginal lavage sample was collected for polymerase chain reaction-based {HPV} testing. Twenty-six percent of the women were {HPV}-positive at the first sampling. Data on {HPV} type was available for 86 {HPV}-positive women (84\%); 35 of these women (41\%) had persistent type-specific {HPV} detection. Persistence decreased with time between samplings. Women aged greater than or equal to 30 years had a higher percentage of persistence (65\%) than those less than or equal to 24 years (32\%, P=.02). The percentage of persistence was higher among women infected with {HPV} types known to be cancer-associated (45\%) than among those infected with other types (24\%,P=.11). These findings were independent of each other and of timing between samplings. Although based on a prevalent cohort, these results are concordant with previous suggestions that {HPV} infection is usually transient and that cervical cancer may arise from within the subset of women with persistent {HPV} infection.},

A new feature of this model is the inclusion of both heterosexual and homosexual interactions. We derive and interpret the basic and invasion reproduction numbers for {HIV} and {HSV}-2 using the approach of next-generation matrices. We then perform scenario analyses and conduct a sensitivity analysis to investigate the impact of the model parameters on the reproduction numbers and disease prevalences. We conclude that homosexual transmission drastically changes the disease prevalences; hence, it is important to account for this interaction as models that ignore homosexuality may greatly underestimate the disease burden.

Outputs from these transmission dynamic models can vary depending on the values of the parameters used to describe the infection. Therefore these values can have an important influence on policy and resource allocation. The risk of progression from infection to pelvic inflammatory disease has been extensively studied but the parameters which govern the transmission dynamics are frequently neglected. We conducted a systematic review of transmission dynamic models linked to economic analyses of chlamydia screening interventions to critically assess the source and variability of the proportion of infections that are asymptomatic, the duration of infection and the transmission probability. We identified nine relevant studies in Pubmed, Embase and the Cochrane database. We found that there is a wide variation in their natural history parameters, including an absolute difference in the proportion of asymptomatic infections of 25\% in women and 75\% in men, a six-fold difference in the duration of asymptomatic infection and a four-fold difference in the per act transmission probability. We consider that much of this variation can be explained by a lack of consensus in the literature. We found that a significant proportion of parameter values were referenced back to the early chlamydia literature, before the introduction of nucleic acid modes of diagnosis and the widespread testing of asymptomatic individuals. In conclusion, authors should use high quality contemporary evidence to inform their parameter values, clearly document their assumptions and make appropriate use of sensitivity analysis. This will help to make models more transparent and increase their utility to policy makers.},

	abstract = {A mathematical model of the transmission dynamics of {HIV}-1 in a heterosexual population stratified by age, sex, and sexual activity (defined by rates of sexual partner acquisition) is presented. The model represents an extension of previous studies with a special focus on patterns of mixing or contact between sexual activity and different age classes of the two sexes. A range of mixing patterns between these groups is specified for both sexes. Mixing is described on two scales from fully assortative to fully disassortative, with random defined either according to numbers of sexual partnerships or numbers of people. The sexual partnerships in the model are balanced by changes in the rates of sexual partner acquisition between particular groups and a range of changes, from only women changing behaviour to only men changing behaviour, are analysed. The pattern of mixing is most influential in determining the shape and magnitude of the epidemic, but the manner in which people choose partners (i.e. dependent on numbers or proportions in the population) is also important. The relative importance of variation in transmission probabilities and mean rates of partner change on the course of the {HIV} epidemic is also illustrated. The analysis of the sensitivity of predictions to changing parameters in the force of infection term of the model provides a theoretical basis from which the influence of control strategies and the demographic effects of {HIV} can be analysed.},

Results: We observe that some policy questions could not be reliably addressed by many of the 43 published economic evaluations we found. Despite this, policy making on universal {HPV} vaccination followed shortly after vaccine licensure in many developed countries, so the role economic evaluation played in informing these decisions (pre-dating 2008) seems to have been fairly limited. For more recent decisions, however, economic evaluation is likely to have been used more widely and more intensively. Conclusions: We expect future cost-effectiveness analyses to be more instrumental in policy making regarding vaccines covering more {HPV} types, therapeutic {HPV} vaccines, and novel diagnostic tests for biomarkers of {HPV} infection and disease integrated with cervical screening programs.},

	abstract = {Background: Vaccines against {HPV}16/18 are approved for use in females and males but most countries currently have female-only programs. Cultural and geographic factors associated with {HPV} vaccine uptake might also influence sexual partner choice; this might impact post-vaccination outcomes. Our aims were to examine the population-level impact of adding males to {HPV} vaccination programs if factors influencing vaccine uptake also influence partner choice, and additionally to quantify how this changes the post-vaccination distribution of disease between subgroups, using incident infections as the outcome measure. Methods: A dynamic model simulated vaccination of pre-adolescents in two scenarios: 1) vaccine uptake was correlated with factors which also affect sexual partner choice ("correlated"); 2) vaccine uptake was unrelated to these factors ("unrelated"). Coverage and degree of heterogeneity in uptake were informed by observed data from Australia and the {USA}. Population impact was examined via the effect on incident {HPV}16 infections. The rate ratio for post-vaccination incident {HPV}16 in the lowest compared to the highest coverage subgroup ({RRL}) was calculated to quantify between-group differences in outcomes. Results: The population-level incremental impact of adding males was lower if vaccine uptake was "correlated", however the difference in population-level impact was extremely small ({\textless}1\%) in the Australia and {USA} scenarios, even under the conservative and extreme assumption that subgroups according to coverage did not mix at all sexually. At the subgroup level, "correlated" female-only vaccination resulted in {RRL} = 1.9 (Australia) and 1.5 ({USA}) in females, and {RRL} = 1.5 and 1.3 in males. "Correlated" both-sex vaccination increased {RRL} to 4.2 and 2.1 in females and 3.9 and 2.0 in males in the Australia and {USA} scenarios respectively. Conclusions: The population-level incremental impact of male vaccination is unlikely to be substantially impacted by feasible levels of heterogeneity in uptake. However, these findings emphasize the continuing importance of prioritizing high coverage across all groups in {HPV} vaccination programs in terms of achieving equality of outcomes.},

	abstract = {Background: Experimental studies have provided strong evidence that human papillomavirus ({HPV}) is the long-sought venereal cause of cervical neoplasia, but the epidemiologic evidence has been inconsistent. Purpose: Given improvements in {HPV} testing that have revealed a strong link between sexual activity history and cervical {HPV} infection, we conducted a large case-control study of {HPV} and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia ({CIN}) to evaluate whether sexual behavior and the other established risk factors for {CIN} influence risk primarily via {HPV} infection. Methods: We studied 500 women with {CIN} and 500 control subjects receiving cytologic screening at Kaiser Permanente, a large prepaid health plan, in Portland, Ore. The established epidemiologic risk factors for {CIN} were assessed by telephone interview. We performed {HPV} testing of cervicovaginal lavage specimens by gene amplification using polymerase chain reaction with a consensus primer to target the L1 gene region of {HPV}. Unconditional logistic regression analysis was used to estimate relative risk of {CIN} and to adjust the epidemiologic associations for {HPV} test results to demonstrate whether the associations were mediated by {HPV}. Results: The case subjects demonstrated the typical epidemiologic profile of {CIN}: They had more sex partners, more cigarette smoking, earlier ages at first sexual intercourse, and lower socioeconomic status. Statistical adjustment for {HPV} infection substantially reduced the size of each of these case-control differences. Seventy-six percent of cases could be attributed to {HPV} infection; the results of cytologic review suggested that the true percentage was even higher. Once {HPV} infection was taken into account, an association of parity with risk of {CIN} was observed in both {HPV}-negative and {HPV}-positive women. Conclusion: The data show that the great majority of all grades of {CIN} can be attributed to {HPV} infection, particularly with the cancer-associated types of {HPV}. Implications: In light of this conclusion, the investigation of the natural history of {HPV} has preventive as well as etiologic importance.},

Additional information about ongoing clinical trials was obtained from manufacturers' Web sites. {DATA} {SYNTHESIS}: Cervarix and Gardasil are recombinant vaccines against {HPV}. Cervarix targets {HPV}-16 and -18, which are responsible for 70\% of cervical cancers. Gardasil also targets {HPV}-16 and -18, plus the {HPV}-6 and -11 types responsible for more than 80\% of genital warts. Both vaccines have been effective in preventing persistent infection with targeted {HPV} types and in preventing cervical intraepithelial lesions, while Gardasil has also been effective in preventing vulvar and vaginal neoplasia and genital warts. Both vaccines have been well tolerated, with the most common adverse effects occurring at the injection site. Phase {III} trials are ongoing to further evaluate vaccine efficacy. {CONCLUSIONS}: Cervarix and Gardasil are effective for prevention of {HPV} infection and cervical lesions.

Sensitivity analysis is a crucial step in the model building and result communication process.

Several interrogations are possible and several sensitivity analysis methods have been developed, giving rise to a vast and growing literature. We present an overview of available methods, structuring them into local and global methods. For local methods, we discuss Tornado diagrams, one way sensitivity functions, differentiation-based methods and scenario decomposition through finite change sensitivity indices, providing a unified view of the associated sensitivity measures. We then analyze global sensitivity methods, first discussing screening methods such as sequential bifurcation and the Morris method. We then address variance-based, moment-independent and value of information-based sensitivity methods. We discuss their formalization in a common rationale and present recent results that permit the estimation of global sensitivity measures by post-processing the sample generated by a traditional Monte Carlo simulation. We then investigate in detail the methodological issues concerning the crucial step of correctly interpreting the results of a sensitivity analysis. A classical example is worked out to illustrate some of the approaches.

Recent studies have demonstrated that measures of health-related quality of life can predict complications and mortality in patients with diabetes, even after adjustment for clinical risk factors. Methods. The authors developed a simulation model of disease progression in type 2 diabetes to investigate the impact of patient quality of life on lifetime outcomes and its potential response to therapy. Changes in health utility over time are captured as a result of complications and aging. All risk equations, model parameter estimates, and input data were derived from patient-level data from the Fenofibrate Intervention and Event Lowering in Diabetes ({FIELD}) trial. Results. Healthier patients with type 2 diabetes enjoy more life years, quality-adjusted life years ({QALYs}), and more life years free of complications. A 65-year-old patient at full health (utility = 1) can expect to live approximately 2 years longer and achieve 6 more {QALYs} than a patient at average health (utility = 0.8), given similar clinical risk factors. For patients with higher {EQ}-5D utility, the additional years lived without complications contribute more to longer life expectancy than years lived with complications. Conclusions. The authors have developed a model for progression of disease in diabetes that has a number of novel features; it captures the observed relationships between measures of quality of life and future outcomes, the number of states have been minimized, and it can be parameterized with just 4 risk equations. Underlying the simple model structure is important patient-level heterogeneity in health and outcomes. The simulations suggest that differences in patients’ {EQ}-5D utility can account for large differences in {QALYs}, which could be relevant in cost-utility analyses.},

A typical result of this paper is as follows: for each \$M {\textgreater} 0\$, suppose that \$f\$ obeys \$\$ \# {\textbackslash}\{t, f(t) {\textbackslash}neq 0 {\textbackslash}\} {\textbackslash}le {\textbackslash}alpha(M) {\textbackslash}cdot ({\textbackslash}log N){\textasciicircum}\{-1\} {\textbackslash}cdot \# {\textbackslash}Omega, \$\$ then with probability at least \$1-O(N{\textasciicircum}\{-M\})\$, \$f\$ can be reconstructed exactly as the solution to the \${\textbackslash}ell\_1\$ minimization problem \$\$ {\textbackslash}min\_g {\textbackslash}sum\_\{t = 0\}{\textasciicircum}\{N-1\} {\textbar}g(t){\textbar}, {\textbackslash}quad {\textbackslash}text\{s.t.\} {\textbackslash}hat g({\textbackslash}omega) = {\textbackslash}hat f({\textbackslash}omega) {\textbackslash}text\{for all\} {\textbackslash}omega {\textbackslash}in {\textbackslash}Omega. \$\$ In short, exact recovery may be obtained by solving a convex optimization problem. We give numerical values for \${\textbackslash}alpha\$ which depends on the desired probability of success; except for the logarithmic factor, the condition on the size of the support is sharp. The methodology extends to a variety of other setups and higher dimensions. For example, we show how one can reconstruct a piecewise constant (one or two-dimensional) object from incomplete frequency samples--provided that the number of jumps (discontinuities) obeys the condition above--by minimizing other convex functionals such as the total-variation of \$f\$.},

	abstract = {Background
Natural history models of human papillomavirus ({HPV}) infection and disease have been used in a number of policy evaluations of technologies to prevent and screen for {HPV} disease (e.g., cervical cancer, anogenital warts), sometimes with wide variation in values for epidemiologic and clinical inputs. The objectives of this study are to: (1) Provide an updated critical and systematic review of the evidence base to support epidemiologic and clinical modeling of key {HPV} disease-related parameters in the context of an {HPV} multi-type disease transmission model which we have applied within a U.S. population context; (2) Identify areas where additional studies are particularly needed.

Methods
Consistent with our and other prior {HPV} natural history models, the literature review was confined to cervical disease and genital warts. Between October 2005 and January 2006, data were gathered from the published English language medical literature through a search of the {PubMed} database and references were examined from prior {HPV} natural history models and review papers. Study design and data quality from individual studies were compared and analyses meeting pre-defined criteria were selected.

Results
Published data meeting review eligibility criteria were most plentiful for natural history parameters relating to the progression and regression of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia ({CIN}) without {HPV} typing, and data concerning the natural history of {HPV} disease due to specific {HPV} types were often lacking. Epidemiologic evidence to support age-dependency in the risk of progression and regression of {HPV} disease was found to be weak, and an alternative hypothesis concerning the time-dependence of transition rates is explored. No data were found on the duration of immunity following {HPV} infection. In the area of clinical management, data were observed to be lacking on the proportion of clinically manifest anogenital warts that are treated and the proportion of cervical cancer cases that become symptomatic by stage.

Conclusion
Knowledge of the natural history of {HPV} disease has been considerably enhanced over the past two decades, through the publication of an increasing number of relevant studies. However, considerable opportunity remains for advancing our understanding of {HPV} natural history and the quality of associated models, particularly with respect to examining {HPV} age- and type-specific outcomes, and acquired immunity following infection.},

While limited knowledge of key disease parameters and networks of spread has impeded development of operational models of gonococcal transmission, new tools in gonococcal surveillance may provide useful data to aid tracking and modeling. Here, we highlight critical questions in the management of gonorrhea that can be addressed by mathematical models and identify key data needs.

The authors show how underlying transition rates can be recovered from partially observed data using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods in {WinBUGS}, and they suggest diagnostics to investigate inconsistencies between evidence from different starting states. An illustrative example for a 3-state model is given, which shows how the methods extend to more complex Markov models using the software {WBDiff} to compute solutions.

	abstract = {A new two-group deterministic model for Chlamydia trachomatis is designed and analyzed to gain insights into its transmission dynamics. The model is shown to exhibit the phenomenon of backward bifurcation, where a stable disease-free equilibrium ({DFE}) co-exists with one or more stable endemic equilibria when the associated reproduction number is less than unity. It is further shown that the backward bifurcation dynamic is caused by the re-infection of individuals who recovered from the disease. The epidemiological implication of this result is that the classical requirement of the reproduction number being less than unity becomes only a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for disease elimination. The basic model is extended to incorporate the use of treatment for infectious individuals (including those who show disease symptoms and those who do not). Rigorous analysis of the treatment model reveals that the use of treatment could have positive or negative population-level impact, depending on the sign of a certain epidemiological threshold. The treatment model is used to evaluate various treatment strategies, namely treating every infected individual showing symptoms of Chlamydia (universal strategy), treating only infectious males showing Chlamydia symptoms (male-only strategy) and treating only infectious females showing symptoms of Chlamydia (female-only strategy). Numerical simulations show that the implementation of the male-only or female-only strategy can induce an indirect benefit of saving new cases of Chlamydia infection in the opposite sex. Further, the universal strategy gives the highest reduction in the cumulative number of new cases of infection. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Background In settings with poor sexually transmitted infection ({STI}) control in high-risk groups, periodic presumptive treatment ({PPT}) can quickly reduce the prevalence of genital ulcers, Neisseria gonorrhoeae ({NG}) and Chlamydia trachomatis ({CT}). However, few studies have assessed the impact on {HIV}. Mathematical modelling is used to quantify the likely {HIV} impact of different {PPT} interventions. Methods A mathematical model was developed to project the impact of {PPT} on {STI}/{HIV} transmission amongst a homogeneous population of female sex workers ({FSWs}) and their clients. Using data from Johannesburg, the impact of {PPT} interventions with different coverages and {PPT} frequencies was estimated. A sensitivity analysis explored how the projections were affected by different model parameters or if the intervention was undertaken elsewhere. Results Substantial decreases in {NG}/{CT} prevalence are achieved among {FSWs} receiving {PPT}. Although less impact is achieved among all {FSWs}, large decreases in {NG}/{CT} prevalence ({\textgreater}50\%) are possible with {\textgreater}30\% coverage and supplying {PPT} every month. Higher {PPT} frequencies achieve little additional impact, whereas improving coverage increases impact until {NG}/{CT} becomes negligible. The impact on {HIV} incidence is smaller, longer to achieve, and depends heavily on the assumed {NG}/{CT} cofactors, whether they are additive, the assumed {STI}/{HIV} transmission probabilities and {STI} durations. Greater {HIV} impact can be achieved in settings with lower sexual activity (except at high coverage), less {STI} treatment or high prevalences of Haemophilus ducreyi. Conclusions Despite the model's assumption of homogeneous risk behaviour probably resulting in optimistic projections, and uncertainty in {STI} cofactors and transmission probabilities, projections suggest {PPT} interventions with sufficient coverage ({\textgreater}= 40\%) and follow-up ({\textgreater}= 2 years) could noticeably decrease the {HIV} incidence ({\textgreater}20\%) among {FSW} populations with inadequate {STI} treatment.},

	abstract = {Background. To determine the potential value of human papillomavirus ({HPV}) vaccines, information concerning the incidence and duration of clinically important lesions is needed. Methods. A total of 603 female university students were followed for a mean duration of 38.8 months. Triannual gynecologic examinations included cervical and vulvovaginal specimen collection for Pap and {HPV} {DNA} testing. Women with cytologic evidence of a high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion ({SIL}) were referred for colposcopically directed biopsy. Results. Among women with incident {HPV} infection, the 36-month cumulative incidence of cervical {SILs} found by cytologic testing (47.2\%; 95\% confidence interval [{CI}], 38.9\%-56.4\%) was higher than that of vaginal {SILs} (28.8\%; 95\% {CI}, 21.3\%-38.2\%). The median time to clearance of cervical and vaginal {SILs} was 5.5 and 4.7 months, respectively. Among women with incident {HPV}-16 or {HPV}-18 infection, the 36-month cumulative incidence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia ({CIN}) grade 2 was 20.0\% (95\% {CI}, 10.8\%-35.1\%), and that of {CIN} grade 3 was 6.7\% (95\% {CI}, 2.5\%-17.0\%). The 36-month cumulative incidence of clinically ascertained genital warts among women with incident {HPV}-6 or {HPV}-11 infection was 64.2\% (95\% {CI}, 50.7\%-77.4\%). Conclusions. Intraepithelial lesions are common early events among women with incident {HPV} infection, and the interval between incident {HPV}-16 or {HPV}-18 infection and biopsy-confirmed {CIN} grade 2-3 appears to be relatively short.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Trachoma programs use mass distributions of oral azithromycin to treat the ocular strains of Chlamydia trachomatis that cause the disease. There is debate whether infection can be eradicated or only controlled. Mass antibiotic administrations clearly reduce the prevalence of chlamydia in endemic communities. However, perfect coverage is unattainable, and the World Health Organization's goal is to control infection to a level where resulting blindness is not a public health concern. Here, we use mathematical models to assess whether more ambitious goals such as local elimination or even global eradication are possible. Methods: We fit a class of non-linear, stochastic, susceptible-infectious-susceptible ({SIS}) models which allow positive or negative feedback, to data from a recent community-randomized trial in Ethiopia, and make predictions using model averaging. Results: The models predict that reintroduced infection may not repopulate the community, or may do so sufficiently slowly that surveillance might be effective. The preferred model exhibits positive feedback, allowing a form of stochastic hysteresis in which infection returns slowly after mass treatment, if it returns at all. Results for regions of different endemicity suggest that elimination may be more feasible than earlier models had predicted. Discussion: If trachoma can be eradicated with repeated mass antibiotic distributions, it would encourage similar strategies against other bacterial diseases whose only host is humans and for which effective vaccines are not available.

	abstract = {In 1992, Watts and May introduced a simple dynamical systems model of the spread of {HIV} based on disease transmission per partnership including the length of partnership duration. This model allowed for the treatment of concurrent partnerships although it was hampered by the assumption of an important latent phase which generated a non-autonomous system. Subsequent models including concurrency have been based on networks, Monte Carlo, and stochastic simulations which lose a qualitative understanding of the effects of concurrency. We present a new autonomous deterministic model of the effect of concurrent sexual partnerships that allows for an analytical study of disease transmission. We incorporate the effect of concurrency through the newly derived force of infection term in a mathematical model of the transmission of {HIV} through sexual contact in a population stratified by sexual behavior and race/ethnicity. The model also includes variations in population mixing (partner choice) and non-uniform Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Treatment ({HAART}) leading to viral suppression. We use this mathematical model to understand the non-uniform spread of {HIV} in women who were infected through heterosexual contact. In addition, an analytical study shows the importance of continued condom use in virally suppressed {MSM}. Numerical simulations of the reproduction number as a function of concurrency, viral suppression level, and mixing show a reservoir of disease present in both heterosexual and {MSM} populations. Statistical analysis of parameter values show that viral suppression level, mixing and progression to {AIDS} without viral suppression have a strong correlation (either positive or negative) with the number of {HIV} positive women. Concurrency and assortative mixing are shown to be essential to reproduce infection levels in women, as reported by 2010 data from the Center for Disease Control ({CDC}).},

	abstract = {Background: Increasingly, countries have introduced female vaccination against human papillomavirus ({HPV}), causally linked to several cancers and genital warts, but few have recommended vaccination of boys. Declining vaccine prices and strong evidence of vaccine impact on reducing {HPV}-related conditions in both women and men prompt countries to reevaluate whether {HPV} vaccination of boys is warranted. Methods: A previously-published dynamic model of {HPV} transmission was empirically calibrated to Norway. Reductions in the incidence of {HPV}, including both direct and indirect benefits, were applied to a natural history model of cervical cancer, and to incidence-based models for other non-cervical {HPV}-related diseases. We calculated the health outcomes and costs of the different {HPV}-related conditions under a gender-neutral vaccination program compared to a female-only program. Results: Vaccine price had a decisive impact on results. For example, assuming 71\% coverage, high vaccine efficacy and a reasonable vaccine tender price of \$75 per dose, we found vaccinating both girls and boys fell below a commonly cited cost-effectiveness threshold in Norway (\$83,000/quality-adjusted life year ({QALY}) gained) when including vaccine benefit for all {HPV}-related diseases. However, at the current market price, including boys would not be considered 'good value for money.' For settings with a lower cost-effectiveness threshold (\$30,000/{QALY}), it would not be considered cost-effective to expand the current program to include boys, unless the vaccine price was less than \$36/dose. Increasing vaccination coverage to 90\% among girls was more effective and less costly than the benefits achieved by vaccinating both genders with 71\% coverage. Conclusions: At the anticipated tender price, expanding the {HPV} vaccination program to boys may be cost-effective and may warrant a change in the current female-only vaccination policy in Norway. However, increasing coverage in girls is uniformly more effective and cost-effective than expanding vaccination coverage to boys and should be considered a priority.},

	abstract = {Cervical cancer is a leading cause of cancer death among women in low-income countries, with similar to 25\% of cases worldwide occurring in India. We estimated the potential health and economic impact of different cervical cancer prevention strategies. After empirically calibrating a cervical cancer model to country-specific epidemiologic data, we projected cancer incidence, life expectancy, and lifetime costs (I\$2005), and calculated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (I\$/{YLS}) for the following strategies: pre-adolescent vaccination of girls before age 12, screening of women over age 30, and combined vaccination and screening. Screening differed by test (cytology, visual inspection, {HPV} {DNA} testing), number of clinical visits (1, 2 or 3), frequency (1 x, 2 x, 3 x per lifetime), and age range (35-45). Vaccine efficacy, coverage, and costs were varied in sensitivity analyses. Assuming 70\% coverage, mean reduction in lifetime cancer risk was 44\% (range, 28-57\%) with {HPV} 16,18 vaccination alone, and 21-33\% with screening three times per lifetime. Combining vaccination and screening three times per lifetime provided a mean reduction of 56\% (vaccination plus 3-visit conventional cytology) to 63\% (vaccination plus 2-visit {HPV} {DNA} testing). At a cost per vaccinated girl of I\$10 (per dose cost of \$2), pre-adolescent vaccination followed by screening three times per lifetime using either {VIA} or {HPV} {DNA} testing, would be considered cost-effective using the country's per capita gross domestic product (I\$3452) as a threshold. In India, if high coverage of pre-adolescent girls with a low-cost {HPV} vaccine that provides long-term protection is achievable, vaccination followed by screening three times per lifetime is expected to reduce cancer deaths by half, and be cost-effective.},

However, the complex natural history of {HPV} makes this difficult. We infer the viral transmissibility, rate of waning natural immunity and rates of progression and clearance of infection of 13 high-risk and 2 non-oncogenic {HPV} types, making use of a number of rich datasets from Sweden. Estimates of viral transmissibility, clearance of initial infection and waning immunity were derived in a Bayesian framework by fitting a susceptible-infectious-recovered-susceptible ({SIRS}) transmission model to age- and type-specific {HPV} prevalence data from both a cross-sectional study and a randomised controlled trial ({RCT}) of primary {HPV} screening. The models fitted well, but over-estimated the prevalence of four high-risk types with respect to the data. Three of these types ({HPV}-33, -35 and -58) are among the most closely related phylogenetically to the most prevalent {HPV}-16. The fourth ({HPV}-45) is the most closely related to {HPV}-18; the second most prevalent type. We suggest that this may be an indicator of cross-immunity. Rates of progression and clearance of clinical lesions were additionally estimated from longitudinal data gathered as part of the same {RCT}. Our estimates of progression and clearance rates are consistent with the findings of survival analysis studies and we extend the literature by estimating progression and clearance rates for non-16 and non-18 high-risk types. We anticipate that such type-specific estimates will be useful in the parameterisation of further models and in developing our understanding of {HPV} natural history.},

	abstract = {Background: Human papillomavirus ({HPV}) is sexually transmitted and causes cervical cancer. Although {HPV} can infect men and women, little is known about infection in men. Specifically, the prevalence of type-specific {HPV} infection and the distribution of infections by anogenital anatomic site in men are incompletely characterized.
Methods: We tested 463 men ages 18 to 40 years for {HPV} at the glans/corona, penile shaft, scrotum, urethra, perianal area, anal canal, and in a semen sample. Eligible men acknowledged no history of genital warts and had sexual intercourse with a woman within the past year. {HPV} testing by {PCR} and reverse line blot genotyping for 37 types was conducted on each of the specimens from the seven sampling sites.
Results: When {HPV} results from any sampling site were considered, 237 (51.2\%) men were positive for at least one oncogenic or nononcogenic {HPV} type, and another 66 (14.3\%) men were positive for an unclassified {HPV} type. The types with the highest prevalence were {HPV}-16 (11.4\%) and 84 (10.6\%). External genital samples (glans/corona, shaft, and scrotum) were more likely than anal samples to contain oncogenic {HPV} (25.1\% versus 5.0\%). {HPV}-positive penile shaft and glans/corona samples were also more likely to be infected with multiple {HPV} types than other sites.
Conclusions: More complete anogenital sampling and sensitive detection for 37 {HPV} types resulted in a higher {HPV} prevalence in primarily asymptomatic men than reported previously. The penile shaft was the site most likely to be {HPV} positive and harbored the greatest proportion of multiple type and oncogenic infections. These results have implications for research of {HPV} among men and transmission between partners. (Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev 2007;16(6):1107–14)},

	abstract = {Purpose of review Acute {HIV} infection ({AHI}), the earliest period after {HIV} acquisition, is only a few weeks in duration. In this brief period, the concentration of {HIV} in blood and genital secretions is extremely high, increasing the probability of {HIV} transmission. Although a substantial role of {AHI} in the sexual transmission of {HIV} is biologically plausible, the significance of {AHI} in the epidemiological spread of {HIV} remains uncertain. Recent findings {AHI} is diagnosed by detecting viral {RNA} or antigen in the blood of persons who are {HIV} seronegative. Depending on the setting, persons with {AHI} represent between 1 and 10\% of persons with newly diagnosed {HIV} infection. The high concentration of virus during {AHI} leads to increased infectiousness, possibly as much as 26 times greater than during chronic infection. In mathematical models, the estimated proportion of transmission attributed to {AHI} has varied considerably, depending on model structure, model parameters, and the population. Key determinants include the stage of the {HIV} epidemic and the sexual risk profile of the population. Summary Despite its brief duration, {AHI} plays a disproportionate role in the sexual transmission of {HIV} infection. Detection of persons with {AHI} may provide an important opportunity for transmission prevention.},

In the first step, the authors utilized primary epidermiologic data from a longitudinal study of women in Brazil and identified a plausible range for each input parameter that produced model output within the 95\% confidence intervals of the data. In the second step, they performed a simultaneous search over all input parameters to identify parameter sets that produced output consistent with data from multiple sources. A goodness-of-fit score was computed for 555,000 unique parameter sets using a likelihood-based approach, and a sample of good-fitting parameter sets was used in the model to illustrate the advantage of the calibration approach by projecting a range of benefits associated with cervical cancer prevention policies. The calibrated model had reasonable fit to the data in terms of duration and prevalence of {HPV} infection for high-risk types, prevalence of precancerous lesions, and incidence of cancer. The authors found that leveraging primary data from longitudinal studies provides unique opportunities for model parameterization of the unobservable nature of {HPV} infection and its role in the development of cervical cancer.},

	abstract = {Gonorrhea, one of the most common sexually transmitted infections worldwide, can lead to serious sequelae, including infertility and increased {HIV} transmission. Recently, untreatable, multidrug-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae strains have been reported. In the absence of new antibiotics, and given the speed with which resistance has emerged to all previously used antibiotics, development of a vaccine would be the ideal solution to this public health emergency. Understanding the desired characteristics, target population, and expected impact of an anti-gonococcal vaccine is essential to facilitate vaccine design, assessment and implementation. The modeling presented herein aims to fill these conceptual gaps, and inform future gonococcal vaccine development. Using an individual-based, epidemiological simulation model, gonococcal prevalence was simulated in a heterosexual population of 100,000 individuals after the introduction of vaccines with varied efficacy (10-100\%) and duration of protection (2.5-20 years). Model simulations predict that gonococcal prevalence could be reduced by at least 90\% after 20 years, if all 13-year-olds were given a non-waning vaccine with 50\% efficacy, or a vaccine with 100\% efficacy that wanes after 7.5 years. A 40\% reduction in prevalence is achievable with a non-waning vaccine of only 20\% efficacy. We conclude that a vaccine of moderate efficacy and duration could have a substantive impact on gonococcal prevalence, and disease sequelae, if coverage is high and protection lasts over the highest risk period (i.e., most sexual partner change) among young people.

	abstract = {Background: Human papillomavirus ({HPV}) vaccine may be commercially available in a few years. We explored the clinical benefits and cost-effectiveness of introducing an {HPV}16/18 vaccine in a population with an organized cervical cancer screening program. Methods: A computer-based model of the natural history of {HPV} and cervical cancer was used to project cancer incidence and mortality, life expectancy (adjusted and unadjusted for quality of life), lifetime costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (i.e., the additional cost of a strategy divided by its additional clinical benefit compared with the next most expensive strategy) associated with different cancer prevention policies, including vaccination (initiated at age 12 years), cytologic screening (initiated at 18, 21, 25, 30, or 35 years), and combined vaccination and screening strategies. We assumed that vaccination was 90\% effective in reducing the risk of persistent {HPV}16/18 infections and evaluated alternative assumptions about vaccine efficacy, waning immunity, and risk of replacement with non-16/18 {HPV} types. Results: Our model showed that the most effective strategy with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of less than \$60 000 per quality-adjusted life year is one combining vaccination at age 12 years with triennial conventional cytologic screening beginning at age 25 years, compared with the next best strategy of vaccination and cytologic screening every 5 years beginning at age 21 years. This triennial strategy would reduce the absolute lifetime risk of cervical cancer by 94\% compared with no intervention. These results were sensitive to alternative assumptions about the underlying patterns of cervical cancer screening, duration of vaccine efficacy, and natural history of {HPV} infection in older women. Conclusions: Our model predicts that a vaccine that prevents persistent {HPV}16/18 infection will reduce the incidence of {HPV}16/18-associated cervical cancer, even in a setting of cytologic screening. A program of vaccination that permits a later age of screening initiation and a less frequent screening interval is likely to be a cost-effective use of health care resources.

	abstract = {Human papillomaviruses ({HPVs}) comprise a diverse group, and have different epithelial tropisms and life-cycle strategies. Many {HPVs} are classified as low-risk, as they are only very rarely associated with neoplasia or cancer in the general population. These {HPVs} typically cause inapparent/inconspicuous infections, or benign papillomas, which can persist for months or years, but which are eventually resolved by the host's immune system. Low-risk {HPVs} are difficult to manage in immunosuppressed people and in individuals with genetic predispositions, and can give rise to papillomatosis, and in rare instances, to cancer. The high-risk {HPV} types are, by contrast, a cause of several important human cancers, including almost all cases of cervical cancer, a large proportion of other anogenital cancers and a growing number of head and neck tumours. The high-risk {HPV} types constitute a subset of the genus Alphapapillomavirus that are prevalent in the general population, and in most individuals cause only inconspicuous oral and genital lesions. Cancer progression is associated with persistent high-risk {HPV} infection and with deregulated viral gene expression, which leads to excessive cell proliferation, deficient {DNA} repair, and the accumulation of genetic damage in the infected cell. Although their life-cycle organisation is broadly similar to that of the low-risk {HPV} types, the two groups differ significantly in their capacity to drive cell cycle entry and cell proliferation in the basal/parabasal cell layers. This is thought to be linked, at least in part, to different abilities of the high- and low-risk E6 proteins to modulate the activity of p53 and {PDZ}-domain proteins, and the differential ability of the E7 proteins to target the several different members of the retinoblastoma protein family.

To explore the synergy between interventions in the context of endemic disease, we consider a general model of infection spread in a heterogeneously mixing population. We consider interventions which may alter individuals' infectiousness, susceptibility, profile of infectiousness through time and survival while infected. Allowing general patterns of overlap and targeting in those receiving the interventions, we show how to compute changes to epidemiological indices such as R(0), and introduce a simple technique for calculating equilibrium prevalences and incidences via an iterated map. We argue for a particular definition of synergy and investigate its behaviour, both analytically and numerically, concluding that it is easiest to achieve synergy between interventions which perform poorly in isolation; implementation strategies that minimize the overlap of different interventions in the population tend to achieve more synergy; and that in populations with heterogeneous risk, interventions that are redundant when universally targeted can regain substantial synergy when applied in a targeted manner.

The solution is obtained using the gradient-projection method. This amounts to solving a time dependent partial differential equation on a manifold determined by the constraints. As t → ∞ the solution converges to a steady state which is the denoised image. The numerical algorithm is simple and relatively fast. The results appear to be state-of-the-art for very noisy images. The method is noninvasive, yielding sharp edges in the image. The technique could be interpreted as a first step of moving each level set of the image normal to itself with velocity equal to the curvature of the level set divided by the magnitude of the gradient of the image, and a second step which projects the image back onto the constraint set.},

We mainly focus upon heterogeneity in individuals' infectivity and susceptibility, though with some allowance also for heterogeneous patterns of mixing. The measures of infectious spread we consider are (i) the probability of a major outbreak; (ii) the mean outbreak size; (iii) the mean endemic prevalence level; and (iv) the persistence time. For each measure, we establish conditions under which heterogeneity leads to a reduction in infectious spread. We also demonstrate that if such conditions are not satisfied, the reverse may occur.

	abstract = {There has been an increasing interest in using expected value of information ({EVI}) theory in medical decision making, to identify the need for further research to reduce uncertainty in decision and as a tool for sensitivity analysis. Expected value of sample information ({EVSI}) has been proposed for determination of optimum sample size and allocation Fates in randomized clinical trials. This article derives simple Monte Carlo, or nested Monte Carlo, methods that extend the use of {EVSI} calculations to medical decision applications with multiple sources of uncertainty, with particular attention to the form in which epidemiological data and research findings are structured. In particular, information on key decision parameters such as treatment efficacy are invariably available on measures of relative efficacy such as risk differences or odds ratios, but not on model parameters themselves. In addition, estimates of model parameters and of relative effect measures in the literature may be heterogeneous, reflecting additional sources of variation besides statistical sampling error. The authors describe Monte Carlo procedures for calculating {EVSI} for probability, rate, or continuous variable parameters in multiparameter decision models and approximate methods for relative measures such as Fisk differences, odds ratios, risk ratios, and hazard ratios. Where prior evidence is based on a random effects meta-analysis, the authors describe different {ESVI} calculations, one relevant for decisions concerning a specific patient group and the other for decisions concerning the entire population of patient groups, They also consider {EVSI} methods for new studies intended to update information on both baseline treatment efficacy and the relative efficacy of 2 treatments. Although there are restrictions regarding models with prior correlation between parameters, these methods can be applied to the majority of probabilistic decision models. Illustrative worked examples of {EVSI} calculations are given in an appendix.},

	abstract = {Background: A vaccine against human papillomavirus ({HPV}) types 6, 11, 16 and 18 is now licensed for use in Canada and many other countries. We sought to estimate the number needed to vaccinate to prevent {HPV}-related diseases and death. Methods: A cohort model of the natural history of {HPV} infection was developed. Model simulations were based on 209 different parameter sets that reproduced Canadian {HPV} type-specific data for infection, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, cervical cancer and genital warts. The number needed to vaccinate was calculated as the number of women who would need to be vaccinated to prevent an {HPV}-related event during their lifetime. Results: Among 12-year-old girls, we estimated that the number needed to vaccinate to prevent an episode of genital warts would be 8 (80\% credibility interval [{CrI}] 5 - 15) and a case of cervical cancer 324 (80\% {CrI} 195 - 757). These estimates were based on the assumption that the vaccine procures lifelong protection and that its efficacy is 95\%. If vaccine protection is assumed to wane at 3\% per year, the predicted number needed to vaccinate would increase to 14 (80\% {CrI} 6 - 18) and 9080 (80\% {CrI} 1040 - does not prevent), respectively. The latter number would be greatly reduced with the addition of a booster dose, to 480 (80\% {CrI} 254 - 1572). Interpretation: Our model predictions suggest that vaccination with the currently available {HPV} vaccine may significantly reduce the incidence of genital warts, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and cervical cancer. However, the benefits (particularly in terms of cervical cancer reduction) are highly dependent on the duration of vaccine protection, on which evidence is currently limited.},

	abstract = {Background: Although the variant lineages of human papillomavirus ({HPV}) types 16 and 18 are well established, their individual associations with high-grade cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia ({CIN}) have not been extensively evaluated. Methods: Study subjects were women participating in the Atypical Squamous Cells of Undetermined Significance/Low-Grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion Triage Study who were positive for {HPV}16 or {HPV}18 at enrollment. These women were followed every 6 months for 2 years. Viral isolates from enrollment samples were characterized by {DNA} sequencing and classified as variant lineages. Results: Over a 2-year study period, {CIN}3 was histologically diagnosed in 291 of the 779 {HPV}16-positive women and 47 of the 275 {HPV}18-positive women. Among women without {CIN}2-3 at enrollment, the risk of subsequent {CIN}3 was 2.7-fold greater for those with {HPV}16 African-2 [95\% confidence interval (95\% {CI}), 1.0-7.0] and 3.1-fold greater for those with {HPV}16 Asian American (95\% Cl, 1.6-6.0), compared with European variants. Relative to infection with {HPV}18 African variants, the risk associating subsequent {CIN}3 was 3.8 (95\% {CI}, 0.9-17.2) for infection with {HPV}18 European variants and 4.8 (95\% {CI}, 1.0-23.6) for infection with {HPV}18 Asian American variants. Similar associations were observed when the 2-year prevalence of {CIN}3 was used as the end point. Further, for those with {HPV}16 European variants, the 2-year prevalence of {CIN}3 was higher in White women than in African American women (P = 0.01); this trend was reversed for those with {HPV}16 African-1 variants (P = 0.22). A similar pattern was present for infections with {HPV}18 European versus African variants. Conclusions: The lineages of {HPV}16 and {HPV}18 variants are associated with differing risks for high-grade {CIN}.},

Over 22,500 women were included in calculation of {RRs} for persistent {HPV} {DNA} detection and cervical neoplasia. {RRs} ranged from 1.3 (95\% confidence interval: 1.1, 1.5) to 813.0 (95\% confidence interval: 168.2, 3,229.2) for {CIN}2-3/{HSIL}+ versus {\textless} {CIN}2-3/{HSIL}+; 92\% of {RRs} were above 3.0. Longer durations of infection ({\textgreater} 12 months), wider testing intervals, {CIN}2-3/{HSIL}+, and use of an {HPV}-negative reference group were consistently associated with higher {RRs}. Thus, {HPV} persistence was consistently and strongly associated with {CIN}2-3/{HSIL}+, despite wide variation in definitions and study methods. The magnitude of association varied by duration of persistence and testing interval. Precise definition and standardization of {HPV} testing, sampling procedure, and test interval are needed for reliable clinical testing. These findings validate {HPV} persistence as a clinical marker and endpoint.},

	abstract = {Background: Decision-makers may consider vaccinating girls and boys with different {HPV} vaccines to benefit from their respective strengths; the quadrivalent ({HPV}4) prevents anogenital warts ({AGW}) whilst the bivalent ({HPV}2) may confer greater cross-protection. We compared, to a girls-only vaccination program with {HPV}4, the impact of vaccinating: 1) both genders with {HPV}4, and 2) boys with {HPV}4 and girls with {HPV}2. Methods: We used an individual-based transmission-dynamic model of heterosexual {HPV} infection and diseases. Our base-case scenario assumed lifelong efficacy of 100\% against vaccine types, and 46,29,8,18,6\% and 77,43,79,8,0\% efficacy against {HPV}-31,-33,-45,-52,-58 for {HPV}4 and {HPV}2, respectively. Results: Assuming 70\% vaccination coverage and lifelong cross-protection, vaccinating boys has little additional benefit on {AGW} prevention, irrespective of the vaccine used for girls. Furthermore, using {HPV}4 for boys and {HPV}2 for girls produces greater incremental reductions in {SCC} incidence than using {HPV}4 for both genders (12 vs 7 percentage points). At 50\% vaccination coverage, vaccinating boys produces incremental reductions in {AGW} of 17 percentage points if both genders are vaccinated with {HPV}4, but increases female incidence by 16 percentage points if girls are switched to {HPV}2 (heterosexual male incidence is incrementally reduced by 24 percentage points in both scenarios). Higher incremental reductions in {SCC} incidence are predicted when vaccinating boys with {HPV}4 and girls with {HPV}2 versus vaccinating both genders with {HPV}4 (16 vs 12 percentage points). Results are sensitive to vaccination coverage and the relative duration of protection of the vaccines. Conclusion: Vaccinating girls with {HPV}2 and boys with {HPV}4 can optimize {SCC} prevention if {HPV}2 has higher/longer cross-protection, but can increase {AGW} incidence if vaccination coverage is low among boys.},

We sought to examine whether inferences from previous models are robust to the relaxation of those unrealistic assumptions. We developed a model of {HIV} transmissions through sexual partnerships assuming that (1) sexual partnerships have variable duration, (2) sexual partnerships are concurrent, and (3) the male-to-female transmission rate is higher than the female-to-male transmission rate, with a focus on the third assumption. Assuming a higher rate for male-to-female than female-to-male transmissions decreases the overall transmission of {HIV} but increases the equilibrium fraction of transmissions during primary {HIV} infection ({PHI}) in long-term partnerships, compared to the case where transmission rates are assumed to be symmetric between males an females. Previous modeling studies that assume symmetric transmission rates between males and females may have overestimated the overall spread of {HIV}, but underestimated the relative contribution of {PHI}. To make robust inferences on the role of different stages of {HIV} infection in the sexual spread of {HIV}, models should take into account that transmission rates may be asymmetric by sex.},

	abstract = {Markov models are useful when a decision problem involves risk that is continuous over time, when the timing of events is important, and when important events may happen more than once. Representing such clinical settings with conventional decision trees is difficult and may require unrealistic simplifying assumptions. Markov models assume that a patient is always in one of a finite number of discrete health states, called Markov states. All events are represented as transitions from one state to another. A Markov model may be evaluated by matrix algebra, as a cohort simulation, or as a Monte Carlo simulation. A newer repre sentation of Markov models, the Markov-cycle tree, uses a tree representation of clinical events and may be evaluated either as a cohort simulation or as a Monte Carlo simulation. The ability of the Markov model to represent repetitive events and the time dependence of both probabilities and utilities allows for more accurate representation of clinical settings that involve these issues.

Then assuming the false-negative rate known, we give a nonparametric maximum likelihood estimator for the tumor latency time distribution. When designing an optimal strategy of post-treatment surveillance, we proceed from the minimum of the expected delay in detecting tumor recurrence as a pertinent criterion of optimality. To solve this problem we give a dynamic programming algorithm. We illustrate the methods by analyzing data on breast cancer recurrence.},

	abstract = {We studied the cost-effectiveness of cervical cancer prevention strategies in the Central and Eastern Europe and Central Asia ({CEECA}) region. The cost-effectiveness of human papillomavirus ({HPV})16/18 vaccination of 12 year-old girls was calculated for 28 countries, under the assumption that vaccination prevents 70\% of all cervical cancer cases and that cervical cancer and all-cause mortality rates are stable without vaccination. At three-dose vaccination costs of I\$ 100 per vaccinated girl (currency 2005 international dollars), {HPV}16/18 vaccination was very cost-effective in 25 out of 28 countries using the country's gross domestic product ({GDP}) per capita as cost-effectiveness threshold (criterion by World Health Organization). A three-dose vaccination cost of I\$ 100 is within the current range of vaccine costs in European immunization programs, and therefore our results indicate that {HPV} vaccination may be good value for money. To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of cervical cancer screening combined with vaccination, we calibrated a published simulation model to {HPV} genotype data collected in Slovenia, Poland, and Georgia. The screening interval was varied at 3, 6, and 10 years starting at age 25 or 30 and ending at age 60. In Slovenia and Poland, combined vaccination and 10-yearly {HPV} ({DNA}) screening (vaccination coverage 70\%, screening coverage per round 70\%) was very cost-effective when the cost of three-dose vaccination was I\$ 100 per vaccinated girl. More intensive screening was very cost-effective when the screening coverage per round was 30\% or 50\%. In Georgia, 10-yearly Pap screening was very cost-effective in unvaccinated women. Vaccination combined with 10-yearly {HPV} screening was likely to be cost-effective if the three-dose vaccination cost was I\$ 50 per vaccinated girl. To conclude, cervical cancer prevention strategies utilizing both {HPV}16/18 vaccination and {HPV} screening are very cost-effective in countries with sufficient resources. In low-resource settings, low vaccine pricing is essential for strategies of combined vaccination and screening to be cost-effective.

	abstract = {There has been growing use of highly active antiretroviral treatment ({HAART}) for {HIV} and significant progress in developing prophylactic {HIV} vaccines. The simplest theories of counterproductive behavioral responses to such interventions tend to focus on single feedback mechanisms: for instance, {HAART} optimism makes infection less scary and thus promotes risky sexual behavior. Here, we develop an agent based, age-structured model of {HIV} transmission, risk perception, and partner selection in a core group to explore behavioral responses to interventions. We find that interventions can activate not one, but several feedback mechanisms that could potentially influence decision-making and {HIV} prevalence. In the model, {HAART} increases the attractiveness of unprotected sex, but it also increases perceived risk of infection and, on longer timescales, causes demographic impacts that partially counteract {HAART} optimism. Both {HAART} and vaccination usually lead to lower rates of unprotected sex on the whole, but intervention effectiveness depends strongly on whether individuals over- or under-estimate intervention coverage. Age-specific effects cause sexual behavior and {HIV} prevalence to change in opposite ways in old and young age groups. For complex infections like {HIV}-where interventions influence transmission, demography, sexual behavior and risk perception-we conclude that evaluations of behavioral responses should consider multiple feedback mechanisms.},

	abstract = {Background: Screening for prostate cancer advances the time of diagnosis (lead time) and detects cancers that would not have been diagnosed in the absence of screening (over-detection). Both consequences have considerable impact on the net benefits of screening. Methods: We developed simulation models based on results of the Rotterdam section of the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer ({ERSPC}), which enrolled 42376 men and in which 1498 cases of prostate cancer were identified, and on baseline prostate cancer incidence and stage distribution data. The models were used to predict mean lead times, overdetection rates, and ranges (corresponding to approximate 95\% confidence intervals) associated with different screening programs. Results: Mean lead times and rates of overdetection depended on a man's age at screening. For a single screening test at age 55, the estimated mean lead time was 12.3 years (range = 11.6-14.1 years) and the overdetection rate was 27\% (range 24\%-37\%); at age 75, the estimates were 6.0 years (range 5.8-6.3 years) and 56 \% (range = 53 \%-61 \%), respectively. For a screening program with a 4-year screening interval from age 55 to 67, the estimated mean lead time was 11.2 years (range = 10.8-12.1 years), and the overdetection rate was 48\% (range = 44\%-55\%). This screening program raised the lifetime risk of a prostate cancer diagnosis from 6.4\% to 10.6\%, a relative increase of 65\% (range = 56\%-87\%). In annual screening from age 55 to 67, the estimated overdetection rate was 50\% (range = 46\%-57\%) and the lifetime prostate cancer risk was increased by 80\% (range = 69\%-116\%). Extending annual or quadrennial screening to the age of 75 would result in at least two cases of overdetection for every clinically relevant cancer detected. Conclusions: These model-based lead-time estimates support a prostate cancer screening interval of more than 1 year.},

	abstract = {Background: The World Health Organization ({WHO}) recommends that the cost effectiveness of introducing human papillomavirus ({HPV}) vaccination is considered before such a strategy is implemented. However, developing countries often lack the technical capacity to perform and interpret results of economic appraisals of vaccines. To provide information about the feasibility of using such models in a developing country setting, we evaluated models of {HPV} vaccination in terms of their capacity, requirements, limitations and comparability. Methods: A literature review identified six {HPV} vaccination models suitable for low-income and middle-income country use and representative of the literature in terms of provenance and model structure. Each model was adapted by its developers using standardised data sets representative of two hypothetical developing countries (a low-income country with no screening and a middle-income country with limited screening). Model predictions before and after vaccination of adolescent girls were compared in terms of {HPV} prevalence and cervical cancer incidence, as was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of vaccination under different scenarios. Results: None of the models perfectly reproduced the standardised data set provided to the model developers. However, they agreed that large decreases in type 16/18 {HPV} prevalence and cervical cancer incidence are likely to occur following vaccination. Apart from the Thai model (in which vaccine and non-vaccine {HPV} types were combined), vaccine-type {HPV} prevalence dropped by 75\% to 100\%, and vaccine-type cervical cancer incidence dropped by 80\% to 100\% across the models (averaging over age groups). The most influential factors affecting cost effectiveness were the discount rate, duration of vaccine protection, vaccine price and {HPV} prevalence. Demographic change, access to treatment and data resolution were found to be key issues to consider for models in developing countries. Conclusions: The results indicated the usefulness of considering results from several models and sets of modelling assumptions in decision making. Modelling groups were prepared to share their models and expertise to work with stakeholders in developing countries.

Methods: Adults diagnosed with genital warts attending the York sexually transmitted disease clinic during two 3-month periods in 2006 and 2007 were enrolled (n = 189). Data on cost of treatment and duration of episode of care were collected from a retrospective case note review. {QALY} loss was calculated by applying estimates of the duration of time for which {QoL} was affected to the previously reported detriment to {QoL} associated with genital warts. Results: The average cost per episode of care was \$286 (139 pound, 95\% Cl: \$246-\$327). Estimated loss of {QALYs} ranged from 0.0045 (95\% Cl: 0.0014-0.0078) to 0.023 (95\% Cl: 0.0072-0.039).

	abstract = {In Germany, vaccination against the most oncogenic {HPV} types 16/18 is recommended by the Standing Committee on Vaccination ({STIKO}) for 12-17 year old girls since March 2007. We developed a dynamic mathematical model for the natural history and transmission of {HPV} infections to estimate the impact of vaccination on incidence and mortality of cervical cancer and its pre-stages, and on anogenital warts. We focused on an extensive model calibration to epidemiologic data for all stages of the natural history model as well as on a detailed implementation of cervical cancer screening modalities in Germany. Our model predicts first a substantial reduction of cervical cancer incidence and mortality over the next 30 years, which is mainly attributable to an increase in screening participation in the 1990s and not to {HPV} vaccination, followed by a further reduction attributable to vaccination. Over the next 100 years, {HPV} vaccination will prevent approximately 37\% of cervical cancer cases even if vaccination coverage is only 50\% (as currently observed in Germany). Consideration of cross-protection results in a further reduction of approximately 7\% of all cervical cancer cases for the bivalent and about 5\% for the quadrivalent vaccine in our model. Vaccination of boys was only reasonable if moderate to high vaccination coverage in girls was not achieved. Strategies should be implemented in Germany to increase {HPV} vaccination coverage among girls thereby making better use of the demonstrated benefits of the vaccine. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Background: We describe transition probabilities for incident human papillomavirus ({HPV}) 16/18/31/33/35/45/52/58/59 infections and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia ({CIN}) 1 lesions.
Methods: Women ages 16 to 23 years underwent cytology and cervical swab {PCR} testing for {HPV} at approximately 6-month intervals for up to 4 years in the placebo arm of an {HPV} vaccine trial. The cumulative proportion of incident {HPV} infections with diagnosed {CIN}, clearing (infection undetectable), or persisting without {CIN}, were estimated.
Results: Most incident infections cleared, without detection of {CIN}, ranging at 36 months from 66.9\% for {HPV}31 to 91.1\% for {HPV}59. There was little variation in the 36-month proportion of incident {HPV}16, 18, and 31 infections followed by a {CIN}1 lesion positive for the relevant {HPV} type (range 16.7\%–18.6\%), with lower risks for {HPV}59 (6.4\%) and {HPV}33 (2.9\%). Thirty-six–month transition probabilities for {CIN}2 ranged across types from 2.2\% to 9.1\%; however, the number of events was generally too small for statistically significant differences to be seen across types for this endpoint, or {CIN}3.
Conclusions: Some incident {HPV} types appear more likely to result in diagnosed {CIN}1 than others. The relative predominance of {HPV}16, vis-à-vis some other high-risk {HPV} types (e.g., {HPV}33) in prevalent {CIN}2/3, appears more directly associated with relatively greater frequency of incident {HPV}16 infections within the population, than a higher risk of infection progression to {CIN}2/3.
Impact: Nearly all incident {HPV} infections either manifest as detectable {CIN} or become undetectable within 36 months. Some {HPV} types (e.g., 16 and 33) appear to have similar risk of {CIN}2/3 despite widely varied incidence. Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev; 20(2); 287–96. ©2011 {AACR}.},

	abstract = {In meta-analysis, between-study heterogeneity indicates the presence of effect-modifiers and has implications for the interpretation of results in cost-effectiveness analysis and decision making. A distinction is usually made between true variability in treatment effects due to variation in patient populations or settings and biases related to the way in which trials were conducted. Variability in relative treatment effects threatens the external validity of trial evidence and limits the ability to generalize from the results; imperfections in trial conduct represent threats to internal validity. We provide guidance on methods for meta-regression and bias-adjustment, in pairwise and network meta-analysis (including indirect comparisons), using illustrative examples. We argue that the predictive distribution of a treatment effect in a new trial may, in many cases, be more relevant to decision making than the distribution of the mean effect. Investigators should consider the relative contribution of true variability and random variation due to biases when considering their response to heterogeneity. In network meta-analyses, various types of meta-regression models are possible when trial-level effect-modifying covariates are present or suspected. We argue that a model with a single interaction term is the one most likely to be useful in a decision-making context. Illustrative examples of Bayesian meta-regression against a continuous covariate and meta-regression against baseline risk are provided. Annotated {WinBUGS} code is set out in an appendix.},

	abstract = {Aim: Clinical trials have shown prophylactic human papillomavirus ({HPV}) vaccines to be effective against infection and disease. We examined whether {HPV} vaccination has the potential to be cost-effective. Methods: A cohort model of the natural history of {HPV} was developed, which fits simultaneously Canadian age and type-specific data for infection, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, cervical cancer ({CC}) and genital warts ({GW}). Quality-Adjusted Life-Years ({QALYs}) lost and costs were estimated using data from the literature. Results: Vaccinating 12-year-old girls (efficacy = 95\%, no waning, cost/course = {CAN}\$ 400) against {HPV}-16/18 and {HPV}-6/11/16/18 is estimated to cost the health provider {CAN}\$ 31,000 (800\%{CrI}: 15,000-55,000) and {CAN}\$ 21,000 (80\%{CrI}: 11,000-33,000) per {QALY}-gained, respectively. Results were most sensitive to age at vaccination, duration of vaccine protection, vaccine cost and {QALY}-lost due to {GW}, and were least sensitive to the medical costs. Conclusion: Vaccinating adolescent girls against {HPV} is likely to be cost-effective. The main benefit of vaccination will be in reducing {CC} mortality. However, unless screening is modified, the treatment costs saved through vaccination will be insignificant compared to the cost of {HPV} immunization. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Design Cost effectiveness analysis from the societal perspective.
Setting United States.
Population Girls and boys aged 12 years.
Interventions {HPV} vaccination of girls alone and of girls and boys in the context of screening for cervical cancer.
Main outcome measure Incremental cost effectiveness ratios, expressed as cost per quality adjusted life year ({QALY}) gained.
Results With 75\% vaccination coverage and an assumption of complete, lifelong vaccine efficacy, routine {HPV} vaccination of 12 year old girls was consistently less than \$50 000 per {QALY} gained compared with screening alone. Including preadolescent boys in a routine vaccination programme for preadolescent girls resulted in higher costs and benefits and generally had cost effectiveness ratios that exceeded \$100 000 per {QALY} across a range of {HPV} related outcomes, scenarios for cervical cancer screening, and assumptions of vaccine efficacy and duration. Vaccinating both girls and boys fell below a willingness to pay threshold of \$100 000 per {QALY} only under scenarios of high, lifelong vaccine efficacy against all {HPV} related diseases (including other non-cervical cancers and genital warts), or scenarios of lower efficacy with lower coverage or lower vaccine costs.
Conclusions Given currently available information, including boys in an {HPV} vaccination programme generally exceeds conventional thresholds of good value for money, even under favourable conditions of vaccine protection and health benefits. Uncertainty still exists in many areas that can either strengthen or attenuate our findings. As new information emerges, assumptions and analyses will need to be iteratively revised to continue to inform policies for {HPV} vaccination.},

The {HPV} vaccines prevent infection with certain species of {HPV} associated with the development of cervical cancer or genital warts. We carried out a {PubMed} search up to 2015 evaluating all randomized studies published in literature. This review discusses the current status of {HPVs} vaccines on the global market, efficacy, safety profiles, controversies and future vaccine developments. Three {HPVs} vaccines are currently on the global market: bivalent, quadrivalent and ninevalent. Bivalent and quadrivalent vaccines can protect against almost 70\% of cervical {HPV}-related cancerous and precancerous conditions and the ninevalent vaccine, instead, provides a protection against almost 90\%. The use of vaccinations raised several controversies in the last years and, currently, is not possible to establish which type of vaccine is most effective, however all of them are safe.

We then consider the need for advances in spatial epidemic models, and draw attention to the lack of models that explore the relationship between communicable and non-communicable diseases.

	doi = {10.1177/0272989X13487947},
	abstract = {Markov models are a simple and powerful tool for analyzing the health and economic effects of health care interventions. These models are usually evaluated in discrete time using cohort analysis. The use of discrete time assumes that changes in health states occur only at the end of a cycle period. Discrete-time Markov models only approximate the process of disease progression, as clinical events typically occur in continuous time. The approximation can yield biased cost-effectiveness estimates for Markov models with long cycle periods and if no half-cycle correction is made. The purpose of this article is to present an overview of methods for evaluating Markov models in continuous time. These methods use mathematical results from stochastic process theory and control theory. The methods are illustrated using an applied example on the cost-effectiveness of antiviral therapy for chronic hepatitis B. The main result is a mathematical solution for the expected time spent in each state in a continuous-time Markov model. It is shown how this solution can account for age-dependent transition rates and discounting of costs and health effects, and how the concept of tunnel states can be used to account for transition rates that depend on the time spent in a state. The applied example shows that the continuous-time model yields more accurate results than the discrete-time model but does not require much computation time and is easily implemented. In conclusion, continuous-time Markov models are a feasible alternative to cohort analysis and can offer several theoretical and practical advantages.},

The results show after 9-year follow-up the hazard ratio of prostate cancer death for screen-detected cases against clinically detected cases increased from 0.24 (95\% {CI}: 0.160.35) without correction for these biases, to 0.76 after correction for leadtime and length biases, and finally to 1.03 (95\% {CI}: 0.791.33) for a further adjustment for over-detection. Adjustment for leadtime and length bias but no over-detection led to a 24\% reduction in prostate cancer death as a result of prostate-specific antigen test. The further calibration of over-detection indicates no gain in survival of screen-detected prostate cancers (excluding over-detected case as stayer considered in the moverstayer model) as compared with the control group in the absence of screening that is considered as the mover. However, whether the model assumption on over-detection is robust should be validated with other data sets and longer follow-up.},

	abstract = {Standard approaches to analysis of randomized controlled trials ({RCTs}) using Markov models make it difficult to generalize treatment effects to new patient groups and synthesize evidence across trials. This paper demonstrates how pair-wise and mixed treatment comparison meta-analysis can be applied to event history data for disease progression reported by {RCTs}. The data, in the form of aggregated discrete time transitions, have a multi-nomial likelihood. In order for evidence synthesis to be performed a structured approach to modelling the differences in the effects of the different treatments must be taken. A multi-state continuous-time Markov model similar to others used in published economic evaluations of asthma treatments is developed, with transition rates related to the likelihood via Kolmogorov's forward equations. The formulation in terms of rates allows a flexible characterization of summary treatment effects. These ideas are applied to an illustrative data set consisting of a set of five trials comparing eight different treatments for asthma. A range of models is developed in which the relative treatment effects act on forward, backward transitions, or both, and models are compared using the {DIC}. Bayesian inferential techniques are used and the parameters are estimated using {MCMC} simulation in {WinBUGS}. An intuitively appealing mechanism of action involving a single parameter acting on all backward transitions was identified for the relative effects of the treatments, which allowed the estimation of a pooled treatment effect, allowing us to rank the different treatment options within each connected evidence network to ascertain which were the most clinically effective.

	abstract = {Objective   To estimate the impact of late {ART} initiation on {HIV} transmission among men who have sex with men ({MSM}) in Mexico.       Methods   An {HIV} transmission model was built to estimate the number of infections transmitted by {HIV}-infected men who have sex with men ({MSM}-{HIV}+) {MSM}-{HIV}+ in the short and long term. Sexual risk behavior data were estimated from a nationwide study of {MSM}. {CD}4 +  counts at {ART} initiation from a representative national cohort were used to estimate time since infection. Number of {MSM}-{HIV}+ on treatment and suppressed were estimated from surveillance and government reports. Status quo scenario ({SQ}), and scenarios of early {ART} initiation and increased {HIV} testing were modeled.       Results   We estimated 14239 new {HIV} infections per year from {MSM}-{HIV}+ in Mexico. In {SQ}, {MSM} take an average 7.4 years since infection to initiate treatment with a median {CD}4 +  count of 148 cells/mm 3 (25 th -75 th  percentiles 52–266). In {SQ}, 68\% of {MSM}-{HIV}+ are not aware of their {HIV} status and transmit 78\% of new infections. Increasing the {CD}4 +  count at {ART} initiation to 350 cells/mm 3  shortened the time since infection to 2.8 years. Increasing {HIV} testing to cover 80\% of undiagnosed {MSM} resulted in a reduction of 70\% in new infections in 20 years. Initiating {ART} at 500 cells/mm 3  and increasing {HIV} testing the reduction would be of 75\% in 20 years.       Conclusion   A substantial number of new {HIV} infections in Mexico are transmitted by undiagnosed and untreated {MSM}-{HIV}+. An aggressive increase in {HIV} testing coverage and initiating {ART} at a {CD}4 count of 500 cells/mm 3  in this population would significantly benefit individuals and decrease the number of new {HIV} infections in Mexico.},

	abstract = {Human papillomavirus ({HPV}) infection is a necessary, although not sufficient cause of cervical cancer. Globally, {HPV} infection accounts for an estimated 530,000 cervical cancer cases (similar to 270,000 deaths) annually, with the majority (86\% of cases, 88\% of deaths) occurring in developing countries. Approximately 90\% of anal cancers and a smaller subset ({\textless}50\%) of other cancers (oropharyngeal, penile, vaginal, vulvar) are also attributed to {HPV}. In total, {HPV} accounts for 5.2\% of the worldwide cancer burden. {HPVs} 16 and 18 are responsible for 70\% of cervical cancer cases and, especially {HPV} 16, for a large proportion of other cancers. Prophylactic vaccination targeting these genotypes is therefore expected to have a major impact on the burden of cervical cancer as well as that of other {HPV}-related cancers. Over the past 50 years, organized or opportunistic screening with Papanicolaou (Pap) cytology has led to major reductions in cervical cancer in most developed countries. However, due to lack of resources or inadequate infrastructure, many countries have failed to reduce cervical cancer mortality through screening. {HPV} {DNA} testing recently emerged as a likely candidate to replace Pap cytology for primary screening. It is less prone to human error and more sensitive than Pap in detecting high-grade cervical lesions. For countries with national vaccination programs. {HPV} testing may also serve as a low cost strategy to monitor long term vaccine efficacy. Introduction of well organized vaccination and screening programs should be a priority for all countries. Increased support from donors is needed to support this cause.

Methods: We used {HPV}-{ADVISE}, an individual-based transmission-dynamic model of multi-type {HPV} infection and diseases (anogenital warts, and cancers of the cervix, vulva, vagina, anus, penis and oropharynx). We conducted the analysis from the health payer perspective, with a 70-year time horizon and 3\% discount rate, and performed extensive sensitivity analyses, including duration of vaccine protection and vaccine cost. Findings: Assuming 80\% coverage and a vaccine cost per dose of \$85, two-dose girls-only vaccination (vs. no vaccination) produced cost/quality-adjusted life-year ({QALY})-gained varying between \$7900-24,300. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of giving the third dose to girls (vs. two doses) was below \$40,000/{QALY}-gained when: (i) three doses provide longer protection than two doses and (ii) two-dose protection was shorter than 30 years. Vaccinating boys (with two or three doses) was not cost-effective (vs. girls-only vaccination) under most scenarios investigated. Interpretation: Two-dose {HPV} vaccination is likely to be cost-effective if its duration of protection is at least 10 years. A third dose of {HPV} vaccine is unlikely to be cost-effective if two-dose duration of protection is longer than 30 years. Finally, two-dose girls \& boys {HPV} vaccination is unlikely to be cost-effective unless the cost per dose for boys is substantially lower than the cost for girls. (C) 2014 The Authors.

	abstract = {This work presents a brief overview of Markov models in cancer screening evaluation and focuses on two specific models. A three-state model was first proposed to estimate jointly the sensitivity of the screening procedure and the average duration in the preclinical phase, i.e. the period when the cancer is asymptomatic but detectable by screening. A five-state model, incorporating lymph node involvement as a prognostic factor, was later proposed combined with a survival analysis to predict the mortality reduction associated with screening. The strengths and limitations of these two models are illustrated using data from French breast cancer service screening programmes. The three-state model is a useful frame but parameter estimates should be interpreted with caution. They are highly correlated and depend heavily on the parametric assumptions of the model. Our results pointed out a serious limitation to the five-state model, due to implicit assumptions which are not always verified. Although it may still be useful, there is a need for more flexible models. Over-diagnosis is an important issue for both models and induces bias in parameter estimates. It can be addressed by adding a non-progressive state, but this may provide an uncertain estimation of over-diagnosis. When the primary goal is to avoid bias, rather than to estimate over-diagnosis, it may be more appropriate to correct for over-diagnosis assuming different levels in a sensitivity analysis. This would be particularly relevant in a perspective of mortality reduction estimation.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Estimates of human papillomavirus ({HPV}) vaccine impact in clinical trials and modelling studies rely on {DNA} tests of cytology or biopsy specimens to determine the {HPV} type responsible for a cervical lesion. {DNA} of several oncogenic {HPV} types may be detectable in a specimen. However, only one type may be responsible for a particular cervical lesion. Misattribution of the causal {HPV} type for a particular abnormality may give rise to an apparent increase in disease due to non-vaccine {HPV} types following vaccination ("unmasking"). Methods: To investigate the existence and magnitude of unmasking, we analysed data from residual cytology and biopsy specimens in English women aged 20-64 years old using a stochastic type-specific individual-based model of {HPV} infection, progression and disease. The model parameters were calibrated to data on the prevalence of {HPV} {DNA} and cytological lesion of different grades, and used to assign causal {HPV} types to cervical lesions. The difference between the prevalence of all disease due to non-vaccine {HPV} types, and disease due to non-vaccine {HPV} types in the absence of vaccine {HPV} types, was then estimated. Results: There could be an apparent maximum increase of 3-10\% in long-term cervical cancer incidence due to non-vaccine {HPV} types following vaccination. Conclusion: Unmasking may be an important phenomenon in {HPV} post-vaccination epidemiology, in the same way that has been observed following pneumococcal conjugate vaccination.

	abstract = {Background The impact of the prophylactic vaccine against human papillomavirus ({HPV}) types 6, 11, 16, and 18 ({HPV}6/11/16/18) on all {HPV}-associated genital disease was investigated in a population that approximates sexually naive women in that they were "negative to 14 {HPV} types" and in a mixed population of {HPV}-exposed and-unexposed women (intention-to-treat group). Methods This analysis studied 17 622 women aged 15-26 years who were enrolled in one of two randomized, placebo-controlled, efficacy trials for the {HPV}6/11/16/18 vaccine (first patient on December 28, 2001, and studies completed July 31, 2007). Vaccine or placebo was given at day 1, month 2, and month 6. All women underwent cervicovaginal sampling and Papanicolaou (Pap) testing at day 1 and every 6-12 months thereafter. Outcomes were any cervical intraepithelial neoplasia; any external anogenital and vaginal lesions; Pap test abnormalities; and procedures such as colposcopy and definitive therapy. Absolute rates are expressed as women with end-point per 100 person-years at risk. Results The average follow-up was 3.6 years (maximum of 4.9 years). In the population that was negative to 14 {HPV} types, vaccination was up to 100\% effective in reducing the risk of {HPV}16/18-related high-grade cervical, vulvar, and vaginal lesions and of {HPV}6/11-related genital warts. In the intention-to-treat group, vaccination also statistically significantly reduced the risk of any high-grade cervical lesions (19.0\% reduction; rate vaccine = 1.43, rate placebo = 1.76, difference = 0.33, 95\% confidence interval [{CI}] = 0.13 to 0.54), vulvar and vaginal lesions (50.7\% reduction; rate vaccine = 0.10, rate placebo = 0.20, difference = 0.10, 95\% {CI} = 0.04 to 0.16), genital warts (62.0\% reduction; rate vaccine = 0.44, rate placebo = 1.17, difference = 0.72, 95\% {CI} = 0.58 to 0.87), Pap abnormalities (11.3\% reduction; rate vaccine = 10.36, rate placebo = 11.68, difference = 1.32, 95\% {CI} = 0.74 to 1.90), and cervical definitive therapy (23.0\% reduction; rate vaccine = 1.97, rate placebo = 2.56, difference = 0.59, 95\% {CI} = 0.35 to 0.83), irrespective of causal {HPV} type. Conclusions High-coverage {HPV} vaccination programs among adolescents and young women may result in a rapid reduction of genital warts, cervical cytological abnormalities, and diagnostic and therapeutic procedures.

	abstract = {Background   Knowledge of the natural history of human papillomavirus ({HPV}), in particular the role of immunity, is crucial in estimating the (cost-) effectiveness of {HPV} vaccination and cervical cancer screening strategies, because naturally acquired immunity after clearing an infection may already protect part of the risk population against new {HPV} infections.       Methods   We used {STDSIM}, an established stochastic microsimulation model, quantified to the Netherlands. We explored different assumptions regarding the natural history of {HPV}-16 and {HPV}-18, and estimated the transmission probabilities and durations of acquired immunity necessary to reproduce age-specific prevalence.       Results   A model without acquired immunity cannot reproduce the age-specific patterns of {HPV}. Also, it is necessary to assume a high degree of individual variation in the duration of infection and acquired immunity. According to the model estimates, on average 20\% of women are immune for {HPV}-16 and 15\% for {HPV}-18. After an {HPV}-16 infection, 50\% are immune for less than 1 year, whereas 20\% exceed 30 years. For {HPV}-18, up to 12\% of the individuals are immune for less than 1 year, and about 50\% over 30 years. Almost half of all women will never acquire {HPV}-16 or {HPV}-18.       Conclusions   Acquired immunity likely plays a major role in {HPV} epidemiology, but its duration shows substantial variation. Combined with the lifetime risk, this explains to a large extent why many women will never develop cervical cancer.},

	abstract = {Background. Human papillomavirus ({HPV}) vaccination was introduced into the routine immunization schedule in the United States in late 2006 for females aged 11 or 12 years, with catch-up vaccination recommended for those aged 13–26 years. In 2010, 3-dose vaccine coverage was only 32\% among 13–17 year-olds. Reduction in the prevalence of {HPV} types targeted by the quadrivalent vaccine ({HPV}-6, -11, -16, and -18) will be one of the first measures of vaccine impact.
Methods. We analyzed {HPV} prevalence data from the vaccine era (2007–2010) and the prevaccine era (2003–2006) that were collected during National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys. {HPV} prevalence was determined by the Linear Array {HPV} Assay in cervicovaginal swab samples from females aged 14–59 years; 4150 provided samples in 2003–2006, and 4253 provided samples in 2007–2010.
Results. Among females aged 14–19 years, the vaccine-type {HPV} prevalence ({HPV}-6, -11, -16, or -18) decreased from 11.5\% (95\% confidence interval [{CI}], 9.2–14.4) in 2003–2006 to 5.1\% (95\% {CI}, 3.8–6.6) in 2007–2010, a decline of 56\% (95\% {CI}, 38–69). Among other age groups, the prevalence did not differ significantly between the 2 time periods (P {\textgreater} .05). The vaccine effectiveness of at least 1 dose was 82\% (95\% {CI}, 53–93).
Conclusions. Within 4 years of vaccine introduction, the vaccine-type {HPV} prevalence decreased among females aged 14–19 years despite low vaccine uptake. The estimated vaccine effectiveness was high.},

	doi = {10.1093/infdis/jiw223},
	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Preexposure prophylaxis ({PrEP}) is effective for preventing human immunodeficiency virus ({HIV}) infection among men who have sex with men ({MSM}) within trial settings. Population impact will depend on clinical indications for {PrEP} initiation, coverage levels, and drug adherence. No modeling studies have estimated the impact of clinical practice guidelines for {PrEP} issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ({CDC}).
{METHODS}: Mathematical models of {HIV} transmission among {MSM} were used to estimate the percentage of infections averted ({PIA}) and the number needed to treat ({NNT}) under behavioral indications of the {CDC}'s {PrEP} guidelines. We modeled the contribution of these indications while varying treatment coverage and adherence.
{RESULTS}: At 40\% coverage of indicated {MSM} over the next decade, application of {CDC} guidelines would avert 1162 infections per 100 000 person-years, 33.0\% of expected infections. The predicted {NNT} for the guidelines would be 25. Increasing coverage and adherence jointly raise the {PIA}, but reductions to the {NNT} were associated with better adherence only.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Implementation of {CDC} {PrEP} guidelines would result in strong and sustained reductions in {HIV} incidence among {MSM} in the United States. The guidelines strike a good balance between epidemiological impact ({PIA}) and efficiency ({NNT}) at plausible scale-up levels. Adherence counseling could maximize public health investment in {PrEP} by decreasing the {NNT}.},

	abstract = {Little is known about the average duration of typespecific human papillomavirus ({HPV}) infections and their patterns of persistence. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the rate of acquisition and clearance of specific {HPV} types in young women. Female university students (n = 621) in Montreal were followed for 24 months at 6-month intervals. At each visit, a cervical specimen was collected. {HPV} {DNA} was detected using the {MY}09/{MY}11 {PCR} protocol followed by typing for 27 {HPV} genotypes by a line blot assay. The Kaplan-Meier technique was used to estimate the cumulative probability of acquiring or clearing a {HPV} infection considering types individually or in high-risk ({HR}) or low-risk ({LR}) groups defined by oncogenic potential. Incidence rates were 14.0 cases/1000 women-months (95\% confidence interval, 11.4-16.3) and 12.4 cases/1000 women-months (95\% confidence interval, 10.4-14.8) for acquiring {HR} and {LR} {HPV} infections, respectively. The 24-month cumulative rates of acquisition were highest for {HPV}-16 (12\%), {HPV}-51, and {HPV}-84 (8\%). Of the incident infections, {HPV}-16 was the most persistent (mean duration, 18.3 months), followed by {HPV}-31 and {HPV}-53 (14.6 and 14.8 months, respectively). {HPV}-6 and {HPV}-84 had the shortest mean duration time ({\textless} 10 months) The mean durations of incident, same-type {LR} or {HR} {HPV} infections were 13.4 months and 16.3 months, respectively. Whereas the majority of episodes with a type-specific {HPV} infection cleared within 2 years, there were many women who were either reinfected with a new {HPV} genotype or presumably experienced reactivation of their initial infection.},

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of {HPV} persistence patterns worldwide. Medline and {ISI} Web of Science were searched through January 1, 2010 for articles estimating {HPV} persistence or duration of detection. Descriptive and meta-regression techniques were used to summarize variability and the influence of study definitions and characteristics on duration and persistence of cervical {HPV} infections in women. Among 86 studies providing data on over 100,000 women, 73\% defined persistence as {HPV} positivity at a minimum of two time points. Persistence varied notably across studies and was largely mediated by study region and {HPV} type, with {HPV}-16, 31, 33 and 52 being most persistent. Weighted median duration of any-{HPV} detection was 9.8 months. {HR}-{HPV} (9.3 months) persisted longer than low-risk {HPV} (8.4 months), and {HPV}-16 (12.4 months) persisted longer than {HPV}-18 (9.8 months). Among populations of {HPV}-positive women with normal cytology, the median duration of any-{HPV} detection was 11.5 and {HR}-{HPV} detection was 10.9 months. In conclusion, we estimated that approximately half of {HPV} infections persist past 6 to 12 months. Repeat {HPV} testing at 12-month intervals could identify women at increased risk of high-grade cervical precancer due to persistent {HPV} infections.},

The common approach for using {DTs} is calculating the expected value ({EV}) based on single-number estimates, but the single-number {EV} method has limited the {DTs}' real-life applications to a narrow scope of decision problems. This paper introduces the stochastic multilevel decision tree ({MLDT}) modeling approach, which is useful for analyzing decision problems characterized by uncertainty and complexity. The {MLDT}'s advantages are shown through a computer simulation program: the Decision Support Simulation System ({DSSS}). The {DSSS} allows users to model probabilistic linear graph networks and provides a hierarchical modeling method for modeling decision trees to present uncertainties more accurately. It consists of three modules: tree analysis networks ({TANs}), the shortest and longest path dynamic programming analysis network, and cost time analysis networks. The paper only discusses the {TAN} module by presenting the {MLDT} concept under the {TAN} of the {DSSS} computer application. The content of the paper includes the modeling approach, its advantages, and examples that can be used in modeling stochastic trees. The {DT}-{DSSS} was verified by conducting several tests and validated by using it extensively for undergraduate courses in civil engineering at the University of Calgary for the last two academic years.},

	abstract = {Surveillance data represent a vital resource for understanding the impact of cancer control interventions on the population cancer burden. However, population cancer trends are a complex product of many factors, and estimating the contribution of any one of these factors can be challenging. Surveillance modeling is a technique for estimating the contribution of one or more interventions of interest to trends in disease incidence and mortality. In this article, we present several approaches to surveillance modeling of cancer screening interventions. We classify models as biological or epidemiological, depending on whether they model the full unobservable aspects of disease onset and progression, or models which reduce the complex process to simpler terms by summarizing portions of the disease process using mostly observed population level measures. We also describe differences between macrolevel models, microsimulation models and mechanistic models. We discuss procedures for model calibration and validation, and methods for presenting model results which are robust with respect to certain types of biased model estimates. As examples, we present several models of the impact of mammography screening on breast cancer mortality, and {PSA} screening on prostate cancer mortality. Both these examples are appropriate uses of surveillance modeling, even though for mammography there is extensive (although somewhat controversial) randomized trial evidence, whereas for {PSA} this biomarker has seen extensive use as a screening test prior to any controlled trial evidence of its efficacy. Some of the models presented here were developed as part of the National Cancer Institute's Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network.},

	doi = {10.1177/0272989X10384738},
	abstract = {Background. Cancer natural history models are essential when evaluating screening/preventative interventions or changes to diagnostic pathways. Natural history models commonly use a state transition structure, but it is often not possible to observe the state transition probabilities required for parameterization. Aim. The work aimed to accurately represent the uncertainty in the parameters of a state transition model for the natural history of colorectal cancer by embedding the problem in the framework of Bayesian inference. Methods. The Metropolis-Hastings algorithm was used to estimate natural history parameters and screening test characteristics by generating multiple sets of parameters from the posterior distribution, which is the probability distribution that is compatible with the observed data. Observed data included colorectal cancer incidence categorized by age and stage, autopsy data on polyp prevalence, and cancer and polyp detection rates from the first round of screening with the fecal occult blood test in England. The approach was implemented using Visual Basic. Results. The results were subsequently examined for convergence using the package {CODA} in R 2.8.0. Outputs from fitting were samples from the joint posterior distribution of the natural history parameters given the epidemiological data. The parameter sets obtained are shown to have a good fit to all the observed data sets. These parameter sets are used when running probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Conclusion. The advantages of this strategy are that it draws efficiently from a high-dimensional correlated parameter space. The algorithm is simple to code and runs overnight on a standard desktop {PC}. Using this method, the parameter sets are drawn according to their posterior probability given calibration data, and thus they correctly summarize the residual uncertainty in the parameter space.},

The workshop took place directly before the 25th International Papillomavirus Conference. Objectives: The aim of the workshop was to develop an international network of investigators engaged in {HPV} modeling and to facilitate open discussion about the structure and parameterization of models, as well as other methodologic concerns. Methods: Thirty-four participants from more than a dozen countries and a variety of settings, representing the authors or coauthors of 82\% of the {HPV} modeling literature, exchanged ideas on fundamental questions in the field. These proceedings, based on the 217-page transcript, were assembled by the Scientific Committee to summarize the ideas of workshop participants in a deidentified, readable fashion. They represent the work and recorded opinions of session participants and do not constitute the official positions of participants as a whole or individually, the Scientific Committee, or any sponsoring organization or entity. Results: In charting a path forward, 3 topics emerged as most pressing: best practices for {HPV} modeling, comparative modeling, and modeling in developing countries.

The mortality for the early detection group is to be compared with a group receiving usual care. Benefit is reflected in a potential reduction in mortality. This article develops a general probability model that can be used to predict cumulative mortality for each of these groups. The elements of the model assume (i) a four-state progressive disease model in which a subject may be in a disease-free state (or a disease state that cannot be detected), preclinical disease state (capable of being diagnosed by a special exam), clinical state (diagnosis by usual care), and a death state; (ii) age-dependent transitions into the states; (iii) age-dependent examination sensitivity; (iv) age-dependent sojourn time in each state; and (v) the distribution of disease stages on diagnosis conditional on modality of detection. The model may be used to (i) compare mortality rates for different screening schedules; (ii) explore potential benefit of subpopulations; and (iii) compare relative reductions in disease-specific mortality due to advances and dissemination of both treatment and early detection screening programs.},

A 9-valent human papillomavirus ({HPV}) vaccine, licensed in 2014, prevents 4 {HPV} types targeted by the quadrivalent vaccine (6/11/16/18) and 5 additional high-risk ({HR}) types (31/33/45/52/58). Measuring seropositivity before vaccine introduction provides baseline data on exposure to types targeted by vaccines. Methods. We determined seroprevalence of {HPV} 6/11/16/18/31/33/45/52/58 among 4943 persons aged 14-59 years who participated in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 2005-2006. Results. Among females, seroprevalence was 40.5\% for any of the 9 vaccine types, 30.0\% for any 7 {HR} types (16/18/31/33/45/52/58), 19.0\% for any 5 additional types (31/33/45/52/58), and 18.3\% for 16/18. Compared with non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks had higher seroprevalence of 31/33/45/52/58 (36.8\% vs 15.9\%) and 16/18 (30.1\% vs 17.8\%), while Mexican Americans had higher seroprevalence of 31/33/45/52/58 (23.6\% vs 15.9\%) (P {\textless} .05 for all). In multivariable analyses of data from females, race/ethnicity, number of sex partners, and age were associated with 16/18 and 31/33/45/52/58 seropositivity. Seropositivity was lower among males than among females (P {\textless} .001 for all type categories). Conclusions. In 2005-2006, about 40\% of females and 20\% of males had serological evidence of exposure to {\textgreater}= 1 of 9 {HPV} types.

Design Systematic review of primary research studies of any design that quantified overdiagnosis from screening for nine types of cancer. We used explicit criteria to critically appraise individual studies and assess strength of the body of evidence for each study design (double blinded review), and assessed the potential for each study design to accurately quantify and monitor overdiagnosis over time. Data sources {PubMed} and Embase up to 28 February 2014; hand searching of systematic reviews. Eligibility criteria for selecting studies English language studies of any design that quantified overdiagnosis for any of nine common cancers (prostate, breast, lung, colorectal, melanoma, bladder, renal, thyroid, and uterine); excluded case series, case reports, and reviews that only reported results of other studies. Results 52 studies met the inclusion criteria. We grouped studies into four methodological categories: (1) follow-up of a well designed randomized controlled trial (n=3), which has low risk of bias but may not be generalizable and is not suitable for monitoring; (2) pathological or imaging studies (n=8), drawing conclusions about overdiagnosis by examining biological characteristics of cancers, a simple design limited by the uncertain assumption that the measured characteristics are highly correlated with disease progression; (3) modeling studies (n=21), which can be done in a shorter time frame but require complex mathematical equations simulating the natural course of screen detected cancer, the fundamental unknown question; and (4) ecological and cohort studies (n=20), which are suitable for monitoring over time but are limited by a lack of agreed standards, by variable data quality, by inadequate follow-up time, and by the potential for population level confounders. Some ecological and cohort studies, however, have addressed these potential weaknesses in reasonable ways. Conclusions Well conducted ecological and cohort studies in multiple settings are the most appropriate approach for quantifying and monitoring overdiagnosis in cancer screening programs. To support this work, we need internationally agreed standards for ecological and cohort studies and a multinational team of unbiased researchers to perform ongoing analysis.},

However, many of the original models investigating the cost effectiveness of different vaccination strategies for the protection of cervical cancer assumed, based on the trial results at that time, that these women received no protection. We developed a deterministic, dynamic transmission model that incorporates the vaccine-induced protection of women with prior exposure to {HPV}. The model was used to estimate the cost effectiveness of progressively extending a vaccination programme using the bivalent vaccine to older age groups both with and without protection of women with prior exposure. We did this under a range of assumptions on the level of natural immunity. Our modelling projections indicate that including the protection of women with prior {HPV} exposure can have a profound effect on the cost effectiveness of vaccinating adults. The impact of this protection is inversely related to the level of natural immunity. Our results indicate that adult vaccination strategies should potentially be reassessed, and that it is important to include the protection of non-naive women previously infected with {HPV} in future studies. Furthermore, they also highlight the need for a more thorough investigation of this protection.},

	abstract = {Background Different models of sexually transmitted infections ({STIs}) can yield substantially different conclusions about {STI} epidemiology, and it is important to understand how and why models differ. Frequency-dependent models make the simplifying assumption that {STI} incidence is proportional to {STI} prevalence in the population, whereas network models calculate {STI} incidence more realistically by classifying individuals according to their partners' {STI} status. Methods We assessed a deterministic frequency-dependent model approximation to a microsimulation network model of {STIs} in South Africa. Sexual behavior and demographic parameters were identical in the 2 models. Six {STIs} were simulated using each model: {HIV}, herpes, syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia, and trichomoniasis. Results For all 6 {STIs}, the frequency-dependent model estimated a higher {STI} prevalence than the network model, with the difference between the 2 models being relatively large for the curable {STIs}. When the 2 models were fitted to the same {STI} prevalence data, the best-fitting parameters differed substantially between models, with the frequency-dependent model suggesting more immunity and lower transmission probabilities. The fitted frequency-dependent model estimated that the effects of a hypothetical elimination of concurrent partnerships and a reduction in commercial sex were both smaller than estimated by the fitted network model, whereas the latter model estimated a smaller impact of a reduction in unprotected sex in spousal relationships. Conclusions The frequency-dependent assumption is problematic when modeling short-term {STIs}. Frequency-dependent models tend to underestimate the importance of high-risk groups in sustaining {STI} epidemics, while overestimating the importance of long-term partnerships and low-risk groups.},

In order to assess these and possible further changes to cervical screening practice in the {UK}, we constructed a mathematical model of cervical {HPV} infection, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and invasive cervical cancer, and of {UK} age-specific screening coverage rates, screening intervals and treatment efficacy. The predicted cumulative lifetime incidence of invasive cervical cancer in the {UK} is 1.70\% in the absence of screening and 0.77\% with pre-2003 screening practice. A reduction in lifetime incidence to 0.63\% is predicted following the implementation of the 2003 {NHSCSP} recommendations, which represents a 63\% reduction compared to incidence rates in the {UK} population if it were unscreened. The model suggests that, after the implementation of the 2003 recommendations, increasing the sensitivity of the screening test regime from its current average value of 56 to 90\% would further reduce the cumulative lifetime incidence of invasive cervical cancer to 0.46\%. Alternatively, extending screening to women aged 65 - 79 years would further reduce the lifetime incidence to 0.56\%. Screening women aged 20 - 25 years would have minimal impact, with the cumulative lifetime incidence decreasing from 0.63 to 0.61\%. In conclusion, the study supports the 2003 recommendations for changes to cervical screening intervals.},

	abstract = {Infectious diseases are controlled by reducing pathogen replication within or transmission between hosts. Models can reliably evaluate alternative strategies for curtailing transmission, but only if interpersonal mixing is represented realistically. Compartmental modelers commonly use convex combinations of contacts within and among groups of similarly aged individuals, respectively termed preferential and proportionate mixing. Recently published face-to-face conversation and time-use studies suggest that parents and children and co-workers also mix preferentially. As indirect effects arise from the off-diagonal elements of mixing matrices, these observations are exceedingly important. Accordingly, we refined the formula published by Jacquez et al. [19] to account for these newly-observed patterns and estimated age-specific fractions of contacts with each preferred group. As the ages of contemporaries need not be identical nor those of parents and children to differ by exactly the generation time, we also estimated the variances of the Gaussian distributions with which we replaced the Kronecker delta commonly used in theoretical studies. Our formulae reproduce observed patterns and can be used, given contacts, to estimate probabilities of infection on contact, infection rates, and reproduction numbers. As examples, we illustrate these calculations for influenza based on "attack rates" from a prospective household study during the 1957 pandemic and for varicella based on cumulative incidence estimated from a cross-sectional serological survey conducted from 1988-94, together with contact rates from the several face-to-face conversation and time-use studies. Susceptibility to infection on contact generally declines with age, but may be elevated among adolescents and adults with young children.},

The resulting delay differential equation model is shown to undergo the phenomenon of backward bifurcation, where a stable disease-free equilibrium co-exists with one or more stable endemic equilibria when the associated reproduction threshold is less than unity. This phenomenon arises due to the re-infection of individuals who recovered from the disease. Using permanence theory, it is shown that Chlamydia will persist in the population whenever the associated reproduction threshold exceeds unity. It is further shown that long latency period could induce positive (decrease disease burden) or negative (increase disease burden) population-level impact depending on the sign of a certain epidemiological threshold quantity and some other conditions. Furthermore, this study shows that adding a time delay (to model the latency period) does not alter the main equilibrium dynamics (with respect to the effective control or persistence of the disease in the community) of the corresponding non-delayed Chlamydia transmission model considered in our earlier study Sharomi and Gumel (2009) [7].

Traditional threshold proximity methods have recently been supplemented by probabilistic sensitivity analysis, and by entropy-based measures of sensitivity.

Both the traditional and the newly suggested sensitivity measures focus entirely on the likelihood of decision change without attention to corresponding changes in payoff, which are often small. Consequently, these measures can dramatically overstate problem sensitivity. {EVPI}, on the other hand, incorporates both the probability of a decision change and the marginal benefit of such a change into a single measure, and therefore provides a superior picture of problem sensitivity.

A vaccine that reduces the incidence of {HPV}-16 infection may provide important public health benefits. Methods: In this double-blind study, we randomly assigned 2392 young women (defined as females 16 to 23 years of age) to receive three doses of placebo or {HPV}-16 virus-like-particle vaccine (40 microg per dose), given at day 0, month 2, and month 6. Genital samples to test for {HPV}-16 {DNA} were obtained at enrollment, one month after the third vaccination, and every six months thereafter. Women were referred for colposcopy according to a protocol. Biopsy tissue was evaluated for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and analyzed for {HPV}-16 {DNA} with use of the polymerase chain reaction. The primary end point was persistent {HPV}-16 infection, defined as the detection of {HPV}-16 {DNA} in samples obtained at two or more visits. The primary analysis was limited to women who were negative for {HPV}-16 {DNA} and {HPV}-16 antibodies at enrollment and {HPV}-16 {DNA} at month 7. Results: The women were followed for a median of 17.4 months after completing the vaccination regimen. The incidence of persistent {HPV}-16 infection was 3.8 per 100 woman-years at risk in the placebo group and 0 per 100 woman-years at risk in the vaccine group (100 percent efficacy; 95 percent confidence interval, 90 to 100; P{\textless}0.001). All nine cases of {HPV}-16-related cervical intraepithelial neoplasia occurred among the placebo recipients. Conclusions: Administration of this {HPV}-16 vaccine reduced the incidence of both {HPV}-16 infection and {HPV}-16-related cervical intraepithelial neoplasia.

The authors conducted model “experiments” to explore the impact of variations in “deep” model parameters using 3 colorectal cancer ({CRC}) models. All natural history models were calibrated to match observed data on adenoma prevalence and cancer incidence but varied in their underlying specification of the adenocarcinoma process. The authors projected {CRC} incidence among individuals with an underlying adenoma or preclinical cancer v. those without any underlying condition and examined the impact of removing adenomas. They calculated the percentage of simulated {CRC} cases arising from adenomas that developed within 10 or 20 years prior to cancer diagnosis and estimated dwell time—defined as the time from the development of an adenoma to symptom-detected cancer in the absence of screening among individuals with a {CRC} diagnosis. Results. The 20-year {CRC} incidence among 55-year-old individuals with an adenoma or preclinical cancer was 7 to 75 times greater than in the condition-free group. The removal of all adenomas among the subgroup with an underlying adenoma or cancer resulted in a reduction of 30\% to 89\% in cumulative incidence. Among {CRCs} diagnosed at age 65 years, the proportion arising from adenomas formed within 10 years ranged between 4\% and 67\%. The mean dwell time varied from 10.6 to 25.8 years. Conclusions. Models that all match observed data on adenoma prevalence and cancer incidence can produce quite different dwell times and very different answers with respect to the effectiveness of interventions. When conducting applied analyses to inform policy, using multiple models provides a sensitivity analysis on key (unobserved) “deep” model parameters and can provide guidance about specific areas in need of additional research and validation.},

	abstract = {Background. The ongoing development of a vaccine against human papillomavirus ({HPV}) raises important questions about the impact of various vaccination strategies. Methods. Two mathematical models are developed to explore the population-level impact of an {HPV} vaccine. The first model focuses on the infection process and the second on the disease process (specifically, cervical carcinoma in situ and cancer). Results. Both population characteristics (ie, sexual mixing and rates of sex partner change) and vaccine characteristics affect the steady state prevalence of {HPV} that would be expected if a vaccine program is implemented. Under a particular set of assumptions, we find that vaccinating both men and women against a specific {HPV} type would result in a 44\% decrease in prevalence of that type whereas vaccinating only women would result in a 30\% reduction. We also find that if a vaccine gives protection against some, but not all, high risk types of {HPV}, the reduction in disease may be less than the reduction in {HPV} because the remaining high risk {HPV} types may replace the disease caused by the eliminated types. Conclusions. A multivalent vaccine containing the majority of disease-causing {HPV} types would greatly reduce the need for colposcopy, biopsy and treatment. However, it is unlikely that Pap-screening programs would become redundant unless the vaccine is highly effective and coverage is widespread. In contrast to less common infections that are primarily restricted to core groups, targeting the vaccine towards the most sexually active individuals is less effective for a common sexually transmitted infection such as {HPV}.},

Study design The authors describe issues and biases relating to censoring, truncation and sampling that arise when estimating partnership duration. Recommendations for study design and analysis methods are presented and illustrated using data from a sexual-behaviour survey that enrolled individuals from an adolescent-health clinic and two {STD} clinics. Survey participants were queried, for each of (up to) four partnerships in the last 3 months, about the month and year of first sex, the number of days since last sex and whether partnerships were limited to single encounters. Participants were followed every 4 months for up to 1 year. Results After adjustment for censoring and truncation, the estimated median duration of sexual partnerships declined from 9 months (unadjusted) to 1.6 months (adjusted). Similarly, adjustment for censoring and truncation reduced the bias in relative risks for the effect of age in a Cox model. Other approaches, such as weighted estimation, also reduced bias in the estimated duration distribution. Conclusion Methods are available for estimating partnership duration from censored and truncated samples. Ignoring censoring, truncation and other sampling issues results in biased estimates.},

	abstract = {Markov models of disease progression are widely used to model transitions in patients' health state over time. Usually, patients' health status may be classified according to a set of ordered health states. Modelers lump together similar health states into a finite and usually small, number of health states that form the basis of a Markov chain disease-progression model. This increases the number of observations used to estimate each parameter in the transition probability matrix. However, lumping together observably distinct health states also obscures distinctions among them and may reduce the predictive power of the model. Moreover, as we demonstrate, precision in estimating the model parameters does not necessarily improve as the number of states in the model declines. This paper explores the tradeoff between lumping error introduced by grouping distinct health states and sampling error that arises when there are insufficient patient data to precisely estimate the transition probability matrix.

Design Cost-utility analysis. Setting {UK}. Population Female and male {UK} population 12 years or older. Methods We adapted a previously developed multi-{HPV} type dynamic transmission to compare four female vaccination strategies, routine vaccination at age 12 years, and routine vaccination at age 12 years combined with temporary catch-up vaccination at ages 12-14, 12-17 and 12-24 years. Main outcomes measures Costs, cases avoided, incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year ({QALY}). Results The model projected that at year 100, each vaccination strategy could reduce the number of {HPV} 6/11/16/18-related cervical cancer, {CIN}2/3, {CIN}1 and genital wart cases among women by 86, 85, 79 and 89\% respectively. Over 25 years, routine vaccination at age 12 years combined with a 12- to 24-year-old catch-up programme was the most effective strategy, reducing the cumulative number of cases of cervical cancer, {CIN}2/3, {CIN}1 and genital warts by 5800, 146 000, 28 000, and 1.1 million respectively. Over 100 years, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios across all strategies ranged from 5882 pound to 11,412 pound per {QALY} gained.

However, precise risk factors for {HPV} infection and its incidence and duration are not well known. Methods We followed 608 college women at six-month intervals for three years. At each visit, we collected information about lifestyle and sexual behavior and obtained cervicovaginal-lavage samples for the detection of {HPV} {DNA} by polymerase chain reaction and Southern blot hybridization. Pap smears were obtained annually. Results The cumulative 36-month incidence of {HPV} infection was 43 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 36 to 49 percent). An increased risk of {HPV} infection was significantly associated with younger age, Hispanic ethnicity, black race, an increased number of vaginal-sex partners, high frequencies of vaginal sex and alcohol consumption, anal sex, and certain characteristics of partners (regular partners having an increased number of lifetime partners and not being in school). The median duration of new infections was 8 months (95 percent confidence interval, 7 to 10 months). The persistence of {HPV} for greater than or equal to 6 months was related to older age, types of {HPV} associated with cervical cancer, and infection with multiple types of {HPV} but not with smoking. The risk of an abnormal Pap smear increased with persistent {HPV} infection, particularly with high-risk types (relative risk, 37.2; 95 percent confidence interval, 14.6 to 94.8).

Population Schoolgirls aged 12 or older.
Main outcome measures Costs, quality adjusted life years ({QALYs}), and incremental cost effectiveness ratios for a range of vaccination options.
Results Vaccinating 12 year old schoolgirls with a quadrivalent vaccine at 80\% coverage is likely to be cost effective at a willingness to pay threshold of £30 000 (€37 700; \$59 163) per {QALY} gained, if the average duration of protection from the vaccine is more than 10 years. Implementing a catch-up campaign of girls up to age 18 is likely to be cost effective. Vaccination of boys is unlikely to be cost effective. A bivalent vaccine with the same efficacy against human papillomavirus types 16 and 18 costing £13-£21 less per dose (depending on the duration of vaccine protection) may be as cost effective as the quadrivalent vaccine although less effective as it does not prevent anogenital warts.
Conclusions Routine vaccination of 12 year old schoolgirls combined with an initial catch-up campaign up to age 18 is likely to be cost effective in the {UK}. The results are robust to uncertainty in many parameters and processes. A key influential variable is the duration of vaccine protection.},

The role of vaccination against {HPV} types 16 and 18, which is recommended routinely for preadolescent girls, is unclear in this age group. Objective: To assess the health and economic outcomes of {HPV} vaccination in older U. S. women. Design: Cost-effectiveness analysis with an empirically calibrated model. Data Sources: Published literature. Target Population: U.S. women aged 35 to 45 years. Time Horizon: Lifetime. Perspective: Societal. Intervention: {HPV} vaccination added to screening strategies that differ by test (cytology or {HPV} {DNA} testing), frequency, and start age versus screening alone. Outcome Measures: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (2006 U.S. dollars per quality-adjusted life-year [{QALY}] gained). Results of Base-Case Analysis: In the context of annual or biennial screening, {HPV} vaccination of women aged 35 to 45 years ranged from \$116 950 to \$272 350 per {QALY} for cytology with {HPV} {DNA} testing for triage of equivocal results and from \$193 690 to \$381 590 per {QALY} for combined cytology and {HPV} {DNA} testing, depending on age and screening frequency. Results of Sensitivity Analysis: The probability of {HPV} vaccination being cost-effective for women aged 35 to 45 years was 0\% with annual or biennial screening and less than 5\% with triennial screening, at thresholds considered good value for money. Limitation: The natural history of the disease and the efficacy of the vaccine in older women are uncertain. Conclusion: Given currently available information, the effectiveness of {HPV} vaccination for women older than 30 years who are screened seems to be small. Compared with current screening that uses sensitive {HPV} {DNA} testing, {HPV} vaccination is associated with less attractive cost-effectiveness ratios in this population than those for other, well-accepted interventions in the United States.},

	abstract = {Only a subset of women with human papillomavirus ({HPV}) infections will become seropositive, and the factors influencing seroconversion are not well understood. We used a multiplex serology assay in women with mildly abnormal cytology results to examine seroreactivity to oncogenic {HPV} genotypes. An unbiased subset of women in the atypical squamous cell of undetermined significance /low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion Triage Study provided blood samples at trial enrollment for serological testing. A Luminex assay based on glutathione s-transferase-L1 fusion proteins as antigens was used to test seroreactivity against eight carcinogenic {HPV} genotypes (16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 45, 52 and 58). We analyzed the relationship between seroprevalence in women free of precancer (N = 2,464) and {HPV} {DNA} status, age, sexual behavior and other {HPV}-related risk factors. The overall seroprevalence was 24.5\% for {HPV}16 L1 and approximate to 20\% for 18L1 and 31L1. Among women free of precancer, seroprevalence peaked in women less than 29 years and decreased with age. Type-specific seroprevalence was associated with baseline {DNA} detection for {HPV}16 ({OR} = 1.36, 95\%{CI}: 1.04-1.79) and {HPV}18 ({OR} = 2.31, 95\%{CI}: 1.61-3.32), as well as for {HPV}52 and {HPV}58. Correlates of sexual exposure were associated with increased seroprevalence across most genotypes. Women who were current or former smokers were less likely to be seropositive for all eight of the tested oncogenic genotypes. The multiplex assay showed associations between seroprevalence and known risk factors for {HPV} infection across nearly all tested {HPV} genotypes but associations between {DNA}- and serostatus were weak, suggesting possible misclassification of the participants' {HPV} serostatus. What's new? Not all women infected with human papilloma virus ({HPV}) develop antibodies to the virus, and the factors that may lead to this seroconversion haven't been well characterized. In addition, there is currently no standardized assay for detecting {HPV} antibodies. In this study, the authors used a Luminex-based serology assay to measure antibody responses against eight carcinogenic {HPV} types. In women with mildly abnormal cervical cytology results, the study found an association between {HPV}-positive antibody titers and several risk factors for {HPV} infection. Smoking, however, showed a negative association with seroconversion.},

	abstract = {Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer in women, worldwide, and knowledge regarding its cause and pathogenesis is expanding rapidly. Persistent infection with one of about 15 genotypes of carcinogenic human papillomavirus ({HPV}) causes almost all cases. There are four major steps in cervical cancer development: infection of metaplastic epithelium at the cervical transformation zone, viral persistence, progression of persistently infected epithelium to cervical precancer, and invasion through the basement membrane of the epithelium. Infection is extremely common in young women in their first decade of sexual. activity. Persistent infections and precancer are established, typically within 5-10 years, from less than 10\% of new infections. Invasive cancer arises over many years, even decades, in a minority of women with precancer, with a peak or plateau in risk at about 35-55 years of age. Each genotype of {HPV} acts as an independent infection, with differing carcinogenic risks linked to evolutionary species. Our understanding has led to improved prevention and clinical management strategies, including improved screening tests and vaccines. The new {HPV}-oriented model of cervical carcinogenesis should gradually replace older morphological models based only on cytology and histology. If applied wisely, {HPV}-related technology can minimise the incidence of cervical cancer, and the morbidity and mortality it causes, even in low-resource settings.},

	doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0136534},
	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: To estimate the impact of late {ART} initiation on {HIV} transmission among men who have sex with men ({MSM}) in Mexico.
{METHODS}: An {HIV} transmission model was built to estimate the number of infections transmitted by {HIV}-infected men who have sex with men ({MSM}-{HIV}+) {MSM}-{HIV}+ in the short and long term. Sexual risk behavior data were estimated from a nationwide study of {MSM}. {CD}4+ counts at {ART} initiation from a representative national cohort were used to estimate time since infection. Number of {MSM}-{HIV}+ on treatment and suppressed were estimated from surveillance and government reports. Status quo scenario ({SQ}), and scenarios of early {ART} initiation and increased {HIV} testing were modeled.
{RESULTS}: We estimated 14239 new {HIV} infections per year from {MSM}-{HIV}+ in Mexico. In {SQ}, {MSM} take an average 7.4 years since infection to initiate treatment with a median {CD}4+ count of 148 cells/mm3(25th-75th percentiles 52-266). In {SQ}, 68\% of {MSM}-{HIV}+ are not aware of their {HIV} status and transmit 78\% of new infections. Increasing the {CD}4+ count at {ART} initiation to 350 cells/mm3 shortened the time since infection to 2.8 years. Increasing {HIV} testing to cover 80\% of undiagnosed {MSM} resulted in a reduction of 70\% in new infections in 20 years. Initiating {ART} at 500 cells/mm3 and increasing {HIV} testing the reduction would be of 75\% in 20 years.
{CONCLUSION}: A substantial number of new {HIV} infections in Mexico are transmitted by undiagnosed and untreated {MSM}-{HIV}+. An aggressive increase in {HIV} testing coverage and initiating {ART} at a {CD}4 count of 500 cells/mm3 in this population would significantly benefit individuals and decrease the number of new {HIV} infections in Mexico.},
